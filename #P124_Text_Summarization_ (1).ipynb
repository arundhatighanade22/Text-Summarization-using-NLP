What could it cost to go over to the supplier’s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away?

Dusk was falling as the … TWO The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for … EPILOGUE church just as night … ABOUT THE AUTHOR INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM BOOKS BY PAULO COELHO CREDITS COVER COPYRIGHT ABOUT THE PUBLISHER TEN YEARS ON I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins that said that : “ reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept . ” I struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible . Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been Roberts declaring that she adored the book . Walking alone down a The Alchemist ! ” What ’ s the secret behind such a huge success ? that God chose for you here on Earth . Whenever we do something we don ’ t all have the courage to confront our own dream . Why ? There are four obstacles . First : we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible . We grow up calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible . But it ’ s still there . afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream . We do not realize that love is just a We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey . against the third obstacle : fear of the defeats we will meet on the didn ’ t really want it anyway . ” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is I ask myself : are defeats necessary ? up eight times . only going to suffer more than other people ? do — we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence . In unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives . the very next day . Then comes the fourth obstacle : the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives . Oscar Wilde said : “ Each man kills the thing he loves . ” And it ’ s true . The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt . We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either . We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal — when it was only a step away . This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it : renouncing joy and conquest . But if you and you understand why you are here . Paulo Coelho Rio de Janeiro November 2002 Translated by Margaret Jull Costa PROLOGUE Translated by Clifford E . Landers THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had Narcissus . daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty . He was so called the narcissus . But this was not how the author of the book ended the story . transformed into a lake of salty tears . “ Why do you weep ? ” the goddesses asked . contemplate his beauty close at hand . ” “ But … was Narcissus beautiful ? ” the lake asked . “ Who better than you to know that ? ” the goddesses said in contemplate himself ! ” PART ONE THE BOY ’ S NAME WAS SANTIAGO . DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church . The roof had fallen in long sacristy had once stood . He decided to spend the night there . He saw to it that all the across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night . searching for it . he had just finished reading as a pillow . He told himself that he made more comfortable pillows . the stars through the half-destroyed roof . before it ended . animals also began to stir . It was as if some mysterious energy could be the other way around : that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule . But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken . name . He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said . So there were times when he read them would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields . Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed . But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days . He had been to the village only until the afternoon . So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag . behind him . each day was like all the others . The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped . It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep . “ How did you learn to read ? ” the girl asked at one point . The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question . He was sure the girl would never days . He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before : the desire to live in one place forever . With the four sheep . He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year . AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same selling their wool . other places . ” But in his heart he knew that it did matter . And he knew that town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering . thought . Maybe that ’ s why they always stay close to me . The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water . seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk ; and they had the boy told them about the sights of the cities . They were content nourishment . him to feel anger toward his faithful companions . He drank a bit and he gathered his jacket closer to his body . He knew that a few great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields . It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer . The jacket . But when he thought to complain about the burden of its withstood the cold of the dawn . grateful for the jacket ’ s weight and warmth . explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read . That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen . His pride for a simple farm family . They worked hard just to have food didn ’ t want to become a priest . That he wanted to travel . they leave they are basically the same people they were when they thinking that the past was better than what we have now . They have who live right here . ” boy explained . son . who travel are the shepherds . ” that held three ancient Spanish gold coins . “ I found these one day in the fields . I wanted them to be a part of women are the most beautiful . ” And he gave the boy his blessing . The boy could see in his happy ; he had already seen many castles and met many women ( but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence ) . He through those parts many times . The world was huge and inexhaustible ; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a is that they don ’ t even realize that they ’ re walking a new road every day . They don ’ t see that the fields are new and the seasons change . All they think about is food and water . thought of other women since I met the merchant ’ s daughter . had arrived there before him and asked for her hand . It ’ s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams . THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house ; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads . The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer . The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep . People said that Gypsies spent their lives always been frightened to death that he would be captured by his hands in hers . showing the old woman that he was fearful . He recited an Our Father silently . the woman sensed it . He quickly pulled his hands away . regretting having come . He thought for a moment that it would be giving too much importance to his recurrent dream . old woman . “ And dreams are the language of God . When he speaks and that ’ s what makes a shepherd ’ s life exciting . sheep are afraid of strangers . But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them . I don ’ t know why . I don ’ t know how animals know the age of human beings . ” give you a lot of time . ” both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids . ” He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were . But she said nothing . times . ” The woman was silent for some time . Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully . The boy laughed — out of happiness . He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure ! your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you . ” The shepherd swore that he would . The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus . that I deserve a part of what you find . “ And this is my interpretation : you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man . ” out the old woman for this ! But then he remembered that he wasn ’ t going to have to pay anything . “ I told you that your dream was a difficult one . It ’ s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary ; only wise men are “ I only interpret dreams . I don ’ t know how to turn them into reality . That ’ s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with . ” “ And what if I never get to Egypt ? ” “ Then I don ’ t get paid . It wouldn ’ t be the first time . ” wasted too much time with him . So the boy was disappointed ; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams . He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of : he went to the market for something bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had The boy knew a lot of people in the city . That was what made need to spend all of his time with them . When someone sees the they wind up becoming a part of that person ’ s life . And then they want the person to change . If someone isn ’ t what others want them her own . He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields . Three days from He started to read the book he had bought . On the very first page it described a burial ceremony . And the names of the people reader wouldn ’ t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names . down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation . in the plaza . wanted to concentrate on his reading . who was capable of doing difficult things . He had already imagined he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front . He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared them as if they were from his personal experience . She would never hoping that the old man would leave him alone . ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches . irritating . ” “ It ’ s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in inability to choose their own Personal Legends . And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world ’ s greatest lie . ” surprised . That ’ s the world ’ s greatest lie . ” travel . ” want to return it at all . The boy noticed that the man ’ s clothing was parts . Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa ; one had only to cross shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day . “ Where are you from ? ” the boy asked . “ From many places . ” from a city near an ancient castle . That ’ s where I was born . ” fearing that he would appear ignorant . He looked at the people in seemed to be very busy . “ It ’ s like it always has been . ” No clue yet . But he knew that Salem wasn ’ t in Andalusia . If it “ And what do you do in Salem ? ” he insisted . king of Salem ! ” alone with one ’ s books . They tell their incredible stories at the time they say some things that are so strange that you don ’ t know how to continue the conversation . do you have ? ” know more about his life . you ’ ve got enough sheep . ” The boy was getting irritated . He wasn ’ t asking for help . It was the conversation . sheep and get going . ” you how to find the hidden treasure . ” old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded . With a movement that was too read what the old man had written in the sand . names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he awed and embarrassed . “ For several reasons . But let ’ s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend . ” The boy didn ’ t know what a person ’ s “ Personal Legend ” was . impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend . ” None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy . But he wanted to know what the “ mysterious force ” was ; the merchant ’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that ! how to realize your Personal Legend . It prepares your spirit and universe . It ’ s your mission on earth . ” “ Even when all you want to do is travel ? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant ? ” and jealousy . To realize one ’ s Personal Legend is a person ’ s only real obligation . All things are one . helping you to achieve it . ” townspeople . It was the old man who spoke first . “ Why do you tend a flock of sheep ? ” “ Because I like to travel . ” The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at shepherds sleep out in the open . Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds . ” daughter . There was surely a baker in her town . about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends . ” as he himself had been interrupted . “ Why are you telling me all this ? ” “ Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend . And you are at the point where you ’ re about to give it all up . ” “ And that ’ s when you always appear on the scene ? ” people don ’ t realize I ’ ve done them . ” had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds . For five years thousands of stones looking for an emerald . The miner was about to more stone — just one more — he would find his emerald . Since the decided to become involved . He transformed himself into a stone it aside . But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone beautiful emerald in the world . The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure . flock . ” “ What about one-tenth of my treasure ? ” The old man looked disappointed . “ If you start out by promising toward getting it . ” The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy . life has its price . This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach . ” The old man returned the book to the boy . And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure . Good afternoon . ” And he vanished around the corner of the plaza . man was right . He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of the old man had said about him . Sometimes it ’ s better to leave the way things were . The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker . So he began to wander through the he knew that Egypt was in Africa . “ Can I help you ? ” asked the man behind the window . strait . The idea frightened him . watching the boy walk away . “ He doesn ’ t have enough money to travel . ” years he had learned everything about shepherding : he knew how the sheep from wolves . He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia . And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals . He decided to return to his friend ’ s stable by the longest route all of Spain . the plaza where he had talked with the old man . Curse the moment I a woman who could interpret his dream . Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd . and didn ’ t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep . He knew everything about each member of his flock : he The wind began to pick up . He knew that wind : people called it the eastern end of the Mediterranean . something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted didn ’ t even remember him . He was sure that it made no difference recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises . to come and go from the baker ’ s shop . A young couple sat on the brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women . It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search that he could have the same freedom . There was nothing to hold the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend . sheep with him . sheep immediately . He said that he had always dreamed of being a almost sure to win . Beginner ’ s luck . ” “ Why is that ? ” “ Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend ; it whets your appetite with a taste of success . ” wool . “ Where is the treasure ? ” he asked . The boy was startled . The old woman had said the same thing . But she hadn ’ t charged him anything . God has prepared a path for everyone to follow . You just have to read the omens that he left for you . ” between him and the old man . He remembered something his grandfather had once told him : that butterflies were a good omen . clovers . “ Just as your grandfather taught you . These are good omens . ” precious stones . The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day . He really was a king ! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves . black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate . “ They are called Urim and Thummim . The black question . at the Pyramids ; that you already knew . But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision . ” make his own decisions . “ Don ’ t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and don ’ t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion . “ A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world . The lad wandered of the most delicious food in that part of the world . The wise man before it was his turn to be given the man ’ s attention . “ The wise man listened attentively to the boy ’ s explanation of explain the secret of happiness . He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours . to spill . ’ “ The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of returned to the room where the wise man was . that are hanging in my dining hall ? Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create ? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library ? ’ nothing . His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him . wise man . ‘ You cannot trust a man if you don ’ t know his house . ’ related in detail everything he had seen . “ ‘ But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you ? ’ asked the wise man . gone . wisest of wise men . ‘ The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels The shepherd said nothing . He had understood the story the old never forget about his sheep . much change . All they wanted was food and water . Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee . That was his work . Personal Legends . But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful . thought . I should have repeated it for him . Then when he spoke sometimes has to take some pride in himself . ” He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier . Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other . In just a few chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground . had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his kneeling at his feet . The boy felt ill and terribly alone . The infidels had an evil look about them . time : only Arabic was spoken in this country . drink that had been served at the next table . It turned out to be a bitter tea . The boy preferred wine . But he didn ’ t need to worry about that right now . What he had about getting it . The sale of his sheep had left him with enough man had known what he was talking about : during the time the boy which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky . He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a was water in the area . The sheep had taught him that . “ Who are you ? ” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish . someone had appeared . “ How come you speak Spanish ? ” he asked . The new arrival was a was from this city . He was about the same age and height as the boy . “ Almost everyone here speaks Spanish . We ’ re only two hours from Spain . ” ask for a glass of wine for me . I hate this tea . ” religion here forbids it . ” The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids . He payment for taking him there . He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn ’ t even have yet . “ I ’ d like you to take me there if you can . I can pay you to serve as my guide . ” “ Do you have any idea how to get there ? ” the newcomer asked . listening attentively to their conversation . He felt uneasy at the out on an opportunity . enough . ” The boy thought it a strange question . But he trusted in the old universe always conspires in your favor . He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young irritated . leave . ” grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of has its thieves . ” The boy trusted his new friend . He had helped him out in a dangerous situation . He took out his money and counted it . taking the money . “ But I have to buy two camels . ” They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier . Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale . They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held . There were that would be unfriendly . He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in . than his friend . most beautiful sword he had ever seen . The scabbard was embossed to his friend . Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few he knew what he would find . He continued to look at the beautiful around . could he find his new companion . The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident . He decided to stay right there and nearby tower and began his chant ; everyone in the market fell to stalls and left . houses surrounding the plaza . He recalled that when the sun had morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him where he couldn ’ t even speak the language . He was no longer a start everything over . could have changed so suddenly and so drastically . He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry . He had never even and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams . now I ’ m sad and alone . I ’ m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me . I ’ m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine . And I ’ m conquer the world . He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions ; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship . the old man had given him . had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate . He could sell the stones and buy a removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket . him was that port towns are full of thieves . Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset : he was trying to tell him not to trust that man . “ I ’ m like everyone not what actually does . ” temperature and feeling their surfaces . They were his treasure . Just handling them made him feel better . They reminded him of the old man . The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy ’ s past . read the omens . ” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment . The old man had said to ask very clear he asked if the old man ’ s blessing was still with him . He took out one of the stones . It was “ yes . ” “ Am I going to find my treasure ? ” he asked . pouch and fell to the ground . The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch . He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch . But as he saw them lying said . An omen . The boy smiled to himself . He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch . He didn ’ t consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted . He so as not to flee from one ’ s own Personal Legend . “ I promised that I and that made him feel more confident . He looked around at the strange place ; it was a new one . thought . Although his new world at the moment was just an empty and he would never forget it . He remembered the sword . It hurt him between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure . HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE . HE had fallen asleep in resume . He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep ; he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books . He walked slowly through the market . The merchants were reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old king he had met . “ This candy merchant isn ’ t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper ’ s daughter . He ’ s doing it because it ’ s the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend . Just by looking at them . It ’ s spoken Arabic and the other Spanish . And they had understood each other perfectly well . it ’ s happening with people . He was learning a lot of new things . Some of them were things had never perceived before . And he hadn ’ t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them . He realized : If I can learn to the world . the narrow streets of Tangier . Only in that way would he be able to his sheep . that he felt every morning . He had been in the same place for thirty years : a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed . Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware . There had been a time when many people knew of his shop : Arab were always well-heeled . In those days it had been wonderful to be have beautiful women at his side as he grew older . on the hill . And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops . But the crystal merchant had no choice . He had lived thirty years to do anything else . He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on . A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop . The boy saw a man appear behind the counter . them . ” The man looked at him without responding . entered the shop and bought some crystal . merchant . laughed . requires me to feed a hungry person . ” “ Because the crystal was dirty . And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts . ” “ I ’ d like you to work in my shop . Two customers came in today really don ’ t know what they ’ re saying . Just as I hadn ’ t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep . “ Do you want to go to work for me ? ” the merchant asked . The merchant laughed . “ Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year … even if you earned a good commission selling every are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there . ” There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the Pyramids . It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy ’ s that moment . The merchant looked anxiously at the boy . All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared . picked up his pouch . some sheep . ” PART TWO THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a would make him happy . The merchant spent the entire day pieces and not to break anything . some money aside . That morning he had done some calculating : if whole year to be able to buy some sheep . who pass at the bottom of the hill . ” might have died if we had come upon a snake . But that ’ s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds . ” The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses . He was selling better than ever … as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’ s major attractions . return to your sheep . Why ask more out of life ? ” the merchant had never met the king . said . But the merchant understood what the boy had said . The boy ’ s having hired the boy . The boy was being paid more money than he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep . away from the business of the display . saying nothing about his dream . The treasure was now nothing but “ I don ’ t know anyone around here who would want to cross the pile of stones . You could build one in your backyard . ” wait on a customer who had entered the shop . him much . But we two have to live with our mistakes . ” “ Why did you think we should have the display ? ” “ I want to get back to my sheep faster . We have to take doing to help us . It ’ s called the principle of favorability . Or beginner ’ s luck . ” during our lives . The most important is to believe only in the one He stopped there . His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law . “ What ’ s the fifth obligation ? ” the boy asked . merchant answered . “ The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a holy city of Mecca . “ Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids . When I was leave someone in charge of the shop ; the crystals are delicate things . pilgrimage were poorer than I . “ All who went there were happy at having done so . They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses . One of tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather . ” “ Because it ’ s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive . That ’ s on living . want to dream about Mecca . I ’ ve already imagined a thousand times seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it . I ’ ve dream about it . ” display . Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way . now able to speak their strange language . Since that morning in the because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was disembark at Tarifa as a winner . words … and about omens . One afternoon he had seen a man at the “ Let ’ s sell tea to the people who climb the hill . ” “ But we could sell tea in crystal glasses . The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses . I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men . ” “ What is it you ’ re looking for ? ” asked the old merchant . earn the money to do so . ” deeply . and everything else there is to know about crystal . I know its is going to expand . And then I ’ ll have to change my way of life . ” that it hasn ’ t been too bad . The shop is exactly the size I always know how to deal with change . I ’ m used to the way I am . ” didn ’ t see before : every blessing ignored becomes a curse . I don ’ t want anything else in life . But you are forcing me to look at wealth worse than I did before you arrived . Because I know the things I thought the boy to himself . They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to himself for being able to do so . There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world . But they could never have taught him Arabic . There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can ’ t “ What does that mean ? ” answered . “ But in your language it would be something like ‘ It is written . ’ ” there ’ s just no way to hold back the river . the top . But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing beautiful crystal glasses . would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware . The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers . climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old . Other shops were opened that served tea in business . and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new . THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN . IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent . especially for this day . He put his headcloth in place and secured it descended the stairs silently . The city was still sleeping . He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass . Then he sat in the sun-filled sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert . When he had It was a bundle of money . Enough to buy himself a hundred and Africa into his own country . He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop . Then the two went off to have some more tea . my sheep . And you have the money you need to go to Mecca . ” The old man said nothing . “ Will you give me your blessing ? ” asked the boy . “ You have Then he turned to the boy . crystal shop . But you know that I ’ m not going to go to Mecca . Just as you know that you ’ re not going to buy your sheep . ” And he gave the boy his blessing . THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS . They filled three and Thummim . realize how long it had been since he had thought of him . For nearly aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride . omens . ” strange sensation that the old king was nearby . He had worked hard thought . Even though the sheep didn ’ t teach me to speak Arabic . But the sheep had taught him something even more important : language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying for something believed in and desired . Tangier was no longer a could conquer the world . dreams are but don ’ t want to realize them . The old king hadn ’ t told could build one in his backyard . And he had forgotten to mention The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things . He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign tea from crystal glasses . It was more activity than usual for this time the old merchant ’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king . had also been like the old king ’ s smile . trying to realize their Personal Legend . He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant . He didn ’ t want to cry with the other people there . He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned . He was more the world . longer happy with his decision . He had worked for an entire year to becoming less important . Maybe because that wasn ’ t really his dream . Who knows … maybe it ’ s better to be like the crystal merchant : boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day tea . done . But maybe I ’ ll never have another chance to get to the an entire desert between him and the Pyramids . Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation : he was actually two hours closer to his treasure … the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn ’ t matter . all the time I need . Why not ? He suddenly felt tremendously happy . He could always go back to being a shepherd . He could always become a crystal salesman anyone ! He was planning as he left the bar . He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant ’ s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert . He held Urim and Thummim in to his treasure . What could it cost to go over to the supplier ’ s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away ? THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of and here I am in a corral . But he had to move on . He believed in omens . All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go . He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an Work — the Philosopher ’ s Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves . He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemist had visited Europe . It was said that he was more than two Stone and the Elixir of Life . The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story . But he would never have thought it more archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers . transform any metal into gold . ” The Englishman could not contain his excitement . He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his thought . And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable . greeted the Englishman . “ Where are you bound ? ” asked the young Arab . his reading . He didn ’ t want any conversation at this point . What he the alchemist would certainly put him to the test . The young Arab took out a book and began to read . The book other important things to do . burial scene that began the book . “ I ’ ve been trying for two years to concentrate . He still had some doubts about the decision he had made . But he was able to understand one thing : making a decision was only the diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision . a mystery to me . off the conversation . The boy closed his book . He felt that he didn ’ t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman . He took In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket . the earth . But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim . I didn ’ t know that they had them in this part of the world . ” “ Did you say a king ? ” he asked . “ I guess you don ’ t believe that a king would talk to someone like “ Not at all . It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a surprising that kings would talk to shepherds . ” me about Urim and Thummim . These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God . The priests carried them in a golden breastplate . ” The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse . “ Who told you about omens ? ” The boy ’ s interest was increasing by the moment . have to find a man who knows that universal language . An alchemist . ” The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss . leaving today for Al-Fayoum . ” you ? ” about the words luck and coincidence . It ’ s with those words that the universal language is written . ” He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with were in search of the alchemist . regretted having said it . But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it . the warehouse boss called to them to come outside . hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me . crazy . ” belts and rifles slung on their shoulders . The Englishman had the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying . will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert . But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what . In the There was a murmur from the crowd . Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God . The boy swore to Jesus Christ . The Englishman said nothing . And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have . The people were also praying to heaven for protection . uncertainly onto their backs . The boy felt sorry for the Englishman ’ s picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse . “ I ’ m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who … ” what the Englishman was saying . The boy knew what he was about boy . The caravan moved toward the east . It traveled during the spent most of his time with his books . The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert . Now everything was quite different from mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants . and of the hoofbeats of the animals . Even the guides spoke very little to one another . remain silent . ” seems old and wise . had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face . It reminded him of the wool from his sheep … his sheep who were always had . probably already forgotten me . That ’ s good . Creatures like the probably wasn ’ t the only one . But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver ’ s comment : maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes . The animals balked at unburden their charges . The drivers carried the freight themselves appoint a new one . But all this happened for one basic reason : no matter how many his books . first few days of the journey . But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind . As soon as he had a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled to the driver his adventures as a shepherd . and that made me feel good . never to me . My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive children . I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed . living . So now I ’ m a camel driver . But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah : people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want . our possessions and property . But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand . ” something that the other needed — as if everything were indeed the desert . were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route . They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes . They came fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting . “ There are The three fell silent . The boy noted that there was a sense of fear experiencing the language without words … the universal language . The Englishman asked if they were in danger . including the danger . ” And he concluded by saying the mysterious word : “ Maktub . ” Englishman . “ Books are like caravans in that respect . ” The immense collection of people and animals began to travel when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — attract attention to the caravan . The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a the nocturnal cold . And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group . The Englishman was unable to sleep one night . He called to the Englishman the story of his life . The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there . World . It ’ s always a positive force . ” animal — or even just a simple thought . rarely recognize that it is working for us . But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success . ” The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands . “ I have watched the caravan as it crossed “ If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal would have been much more difficult . ” They stood there looking at the moon . speaks to the soul of the desert . ” caravan . ” that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books : all things are the manifestation of one thing only . In one of the books he learned that the most important text in inscribed on the surface of an emerald . might teach something to the boy . The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists . They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories ; they believed World . This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything things communicated . They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid . “ Can ’ t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language ? ” the boy asked . has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters . ” The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was alchemist from growing old . And the solid part was called the Philosopher ’ s Stone . observing the fire that purified the metals . They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world . They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves . ” The boy thought about the crystal merchant . He had said that it could free himself from negative thoughts . The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one ’ s daily life . fascinating property . A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold . ” transform everything into gold . He read the lives of the various and Geber . They were fascinating stories : each of them lived out his Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life . But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master “ WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED ? ” HE asked the Englishman and missed his books . “ So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can transforming lead into gold . Gold would lose its value . middle of the desert . I ’ m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes . ” “ When were these books written ? ” the boy asked . “ Many centuries ago . ” argued . “ There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy . The Englishman didn ’ t answer him directly . He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent . THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman . “ Did might be . He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war . understands that soul can also understand the language of things . I they could be written on the surface of an emerald . ” magic the strange and the laboratory equipment … none of this had made an impression on the boy . His He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags . and the sand raised by the animals . “ Everyone has his or her own THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT . THE hooded Bedouins had become a good friend of the boy ’ s — explained that the war between the tribes had already begun . The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis . themselves less and less . The silence was the worst aspect of the because it might signal a raid . the threat of war . “ Because I don ’ t live in either my past or my future . I ’ m interested only in the present . If you can concentrate always on the looked for the star they followed every night . He thought that the stars on the desert itself . “ Because we have to sleep . ” early . But the boy was quiet . He was at home with the silence of the would just be a memory . But this was the present moment — the party the camel driver had mentioned — and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future . Although could herald a miracle . as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the excitement at the arrival of the strangers . The alchemist saw the at length . But none of that mattered to the alchemist . He had already seen had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands . The dunes sands he had known since he was a child . He always enjoyed seeing Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date He decided to concentrate on more practical matters . He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets . The omens had told him so . He didn ’ t know the man He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice . I don ’ t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures . He had only one explanation for this fact : things have to be and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words . wind up forgetting the Language of the World . being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back and innumerable colored tents spread among them . impatient to meet with the alchemist . animals and people that were arriving . The men of the oasis wanted with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants . The silence of the desert was a distant world and found themselves once again in the world of people . They were relieved and happy . camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always inhabitants were women and children . There were oases leaving the oases as places of refuge . people together and gave them his instructions . The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was accommodations . That was the law of hospitality . Then he asked the men appointed by the tribal chieftains . may not shelter armies or troops . ” revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms . “ Why a revolver ? ” he asked . seemed as if what the old king had called “ beginner ’ s luck ” were no constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage . So he he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path . God placed them along my path . He had surprised himself with job . He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do . driver said : ‘ Eat when it ’ s time to eat . And move along when it ’ s time to move along . ’ ” tent with five other young men of about his age . They were people tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent . outside . “ I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives . ” probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined ; there were hundreds of tents . sitting down with the boy near one of the wells . The Englishman didn ’ t want to tell others about his reasons for The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water . alchemist lives here at the oasis . ” because they were married women . He should respect tradition . The Englishman was disappointed . It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing . The boy was also saddened ; his friend was that ’ s what the old king had said . He couldn ’ t have been wrong . The Englishman ’ s eyes lit up . “ That ’ s it ! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is ! Find out who it is who cures the people ’ s illnesses ! ” insistence . Then a man approached . “ Do you know someone here who cures people ’ s illnesses ? ” the boy asked . strangers . “ You ’ re looking for witch doctors . ” He spoke some verses bucket . The boy repeated his question . “ Why do you want to find that sort of person ? ” the Arab asked . “ Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to . Only when he consents . “ Wait for the end of the war . Then leave with the caravan . Don ’ t But the Englishman was exultant . They were on the right track . ask about the alchemist . Soul of the World surged within him . When he looked into her dark he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart . It was love . Something older than crystals and in the silence of the desert . It was the pure Language of the World . It required no endless time . What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in than of anything in the world . He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed . But maybe people who felt that way under the sun has been written by one hand only . It is the hand that the same . “ What ’ s your name ? ” he asked . “ That ’ s what some women in my country are called . ” invaders carried the name everywhere . ” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride . man who cured people ’ s illnesses . said . “ He communicates with the genies of the desert . ” The genies were the spirits of good and evil . And the girl pointed she filled her vessel with water and left . day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that she existed . He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world . asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold . I told him that was what I had come here to learn . “ He told me I should try to do so . That ’ s all he said : ‘ Go and try . ’ ” The boy didn ’ t say anything . The poor Englishman had traveled already done so many times . “ That ’ s what I ’ m going to do . I ’ m going to start now . ” water . my wife . I love you . ” “ I ’ m going to wait here for you every day . I have crossed the it brought me to you . ” The boy looked around him at the date palms . He reminded shepherd again . Fatima was more important than his treasure . if she had guessed what he was thinking . “ And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen . ” She refilled her vessel and left . The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima . He told of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him . important to both armies . It ’ s not a battle of good against evil . It ’ s a Allah is on both sides . ” went to meet with Fatima that afternoon . He told her about the become a part of you . ” more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms . “ I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time . I which men of the desert expect women to behave . Ever since I was a The boy wanted to take her hand . But Fatima ’ s hands held to the handles of her jug . it . “ That ’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal . If you have our love for each other . come back one day . ” The boy was sad as he left her that day . He thought of all the married shepherds he had known . They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields . Love required them to stay with the people they loved . hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth . They become a part of everything … they become the Soul of the World . “ Some do come back . And then the other women are happy too will be one of the women who wait . The boy went to look for the Englishman . He wanted to tell him about Fatima . He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman they had when he was reading his books . was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master But I ’ m happy at least that I didn ’ t wait twenty years . ” desert turned pink in the setting sun . He felt the urge to go out into to become hypnotized by the horizon . He tried to deal with the He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind . Although sense to the boy . It was just that he couldn ’ t grasp what it meant . He it . Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership . everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me … even the materialized over the sands of the desert . But he certainly didn ’ t desire that an army invade the oasis . meditation . He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the that wouldn ’ t allow him to do so . to occur . dangerous . observing the sunset . He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes . answered . But the boy told him about the hawks : that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World . The camel driver understood what the boy was saying . He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history means of penetration to the Soul of the World . The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World . They would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be ; the future was of many things : Where was the enemy ’ s sword ? Where was his horse ? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to consulted with seers . Many of them had been right about what they had ever sought out ( and the one most to be feared ) had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future . change those things that I don ’ t want to happen . ” said . myself for what ’ s coming . ” greatly before they even occur . ” driver had said to the seer . “ And men always live their lives based on the future . ” The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs ; he threw them cloth and put them back in his bag . omens that are here in the present . guess at the future ? Based on the omens of the present . The secret is The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future . that was written so as to be altered . ” thought . Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument ? “ Tell them about the armies that are approaching . ” “ They ’ ll laugh at me . ” to dealing with omens . ” “ They ’ re not concerned with that right now . They believe that if someone will tell them about it . It has happened many times before . The boy thought of Fatima . And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes . THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis . “ I want to see the chieftains . I ’ ve brought omens from the desert . ” into the tent . conversation with her . boy was astonished by what he saw inside . Never could he have like this one . The ground was covered with the most beautiful resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions . Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea . Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs . The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke . which of them was the most important : an Arab dressed in white young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier . “ Who is this stranger who speaks of omens ? ” asked one of the knows that we have been here for generations ? ” said another of the chieftains . said . “ I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see . ” to himself . third chieftain . you don ’ t have to do anything about it . ” The men fell into an animated discussion . They spoke in an told him that something was wrong . He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert . and the boy felt better . The man hadn ’ t participated in the feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent . Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming . The discussion ended . The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying . Then he turned to the boy : this time his expression was cold and distant . know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them . ” “ We always observe the Tradition . The Tradition saved Egypt how their children should marry . The Tradition says that an oasis is vulnerable . ” No one said a word as the old man continued . “ But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert . Everything we know was taught to us by the desert . ” again : no one at the oasis may carry arms . Throughout the entire day we will once again surrender their arms to me . For every ten dead men “ But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle . Arms time they might not function . If at least one of them hasn ’ t been began to make his way there . He was alarmed by what had happened . He had succeeded in having done so might be his life . It was a frightening bet . But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day . Every day was there to be lived or to mark one ’ s departure from this world . Everything depended on one word : “ Maktub . ” silence of the desert and Fatima ’ s eyes . He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago . If he died and he was proud of that . the ground by a wind such as he had never known . The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view . Before frightening scream . what he saw . Astride the animal was a horseman dressed with a black kerchief . He appeared to be a messenger from the mere messenger . scabbard mounted on his saddle . The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon . “ Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks ? ” he fifty thousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum . except that now the roles were reversed . I was able to see through to the Soul of the World . ” until the point touched the boy ’ s forehead . It drew a droplet of blood . sense of joy : he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend . that Soul . The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy ’ s forehead . “ Why did you read the flight of the birds ? ” “ I read only what the birds wanted to tell me . They wanted to men at the oasis than you have . ” The sword remained where it was . “ Who are you to change what Allah has willed ? ” taught me the language of the birds . Everything has been written by words . the boy felt immensely relieved . But he still couldn ’ t flee . of the battle . ” The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer . But he kept the sword in his hand . “ What is a stranger doing in a strange land ? ” “ I am following my Personal Legend . It ’ s not something you would understand . ” relaxed . quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World . ” The boy was surprised . The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about . those who become distracted . ” What he said reminded the boy of the old king . The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip . away . The hand with the whip pointed to the south . The boy had met the alchemist . throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum . Before the sun had horizon . The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north ; it hidden in their robes . When they reached the white tent at the they attacked an empty tent . The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead . The and saw nothing of what had happened . The women had remained The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion . asked him why he had violated the Tradition . The commander said return to the war . that the Tradition was sacred . He condemned the commander to desert wind . asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis . and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies . But the boy sat down and waited . Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view . He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder . Personal Legend that brings you here ? ” desert . So I have come here . ” boy should enter the tent with him . It was a tent like many at the oasis . The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus mysterious designs . said the alchemist . The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen scent of the hookahs . “ Why did you want to see me ? ” the boy asked . Englishman . He ’ s the one that ’ s looking for you . ” “ He has other things to do first . But he ’ s on the right track . He has begun to try to understand the desert . ” “ And what about me ? ” Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend . “ So you are going to instruct me ? ” “ No . You already know all you need to know . I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure . ” “ I know what ’ s happening in the desert . ” “ I also have Fatima . She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won . ” They ate in silence . The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy ’ s cup . It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted . “ Isn ’ t wine prohibited here ? ” the boy asked alchemist . “ It ’ s what comes out of their mouths that is . ” under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale . everything you have learned along the way can make sense . traitorous : they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire . they are about to die . ” where there is life out in the desert . Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure . ” thought . I don ’ t know the desert that well yet . man . They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the And then the boy understood . He loosened the reins on his followed as the boy ’ s horse ran for almost half an hour . They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above alchemist ’ s eyes — the boy could see only his eyes — squinted with his effort . His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the minutes . with the snakes of the desert . The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and then he placed the snake within it . The serpent relaxed immediately . “ Why was that so important ? ” “ Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert . ” The boy didn ’ t want to talk about the Pyramids . His heart was continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima . treasure . ” knows that men have to go away in order to return . And she already has her treasure : it ’ s you . Now she expects that you will find what it is you ’ re looking for . ” “ Let me tell you what will happen . You ’ ll be the counselor of the oasis . You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels . how the world is always changing . And you ’ ll get better and better there is . try to ignore them . You ’ ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants . The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do . And your camels will bring you wealth and power . she ’ ll return your love . You ’ ll remember that she never asked you to man . So you won ’ t blame her . But many times you ’ ll walk the sands could have trusted more in your love for Fatima . Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back . forever . and a great deal of merchandise . You ’ ll spend the rest of your days it ’ s too late . “ You must understand that love never keeps a man from because it wasn ’ t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World . ” slithered away among the rocks . The boy remembered the crystal Englishman in search of the alchemist . He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert . And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved . followed the alchemist back to the oasis . The wind brought the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of Legend . in his heart . response . friend enough gold to buy a sheep . Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was buy yet another sheep . sheep . Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent . The two walked out among the palms . The boy knew that it was a violation of the coming back . I love you because … ” one is loved . No reason is needed for loving . ” the entire universe conspired to help me find you . ” The two embraced . It was the first time either had touched the other . then . ” They said nothing else . They walked a bit farther among the said . He saw that Fatima ’ s eyes were filled with tears . “ You ’ re crying ? ” out to do the chores she had done for years . But everything had never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday . It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three place for her . boy was following in search of his treasure . She would have to send the hope for his return . the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert . forever . ” boy said . He was already reaccustomed to the desert ’ s silence . one can always come back . If what you had found was only a on your return . ” The man was speaking the language of alchemy . But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima . It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind . The camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it . Maybe the speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to failed to observe . offered his water container to the boy . “ I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend . ” thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know . A alchemy . But I wasn ’ t able to learn anything from them . ” through action . Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey . You need to learn only one thing more . ” “ Why are you called the alchemist ? ” “ Because that ’ s what I am . ” “ And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so ? ” wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend . ” “ What is it that I still need to know ? ” the boy asked . But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon . And finally the falcon returned with their meal . They dug a hole and lit their fire feel that they knew a better way than others had . Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today . ” “ What was written on the Emerald Tablet ? ” the boy wanted to know . as if it had taken place years and years ago . The boy tried to read what was written in the sand . saw in the Englishman ’ s books . ” hawks ; it can ’ t be understood by reason alone . The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World . “ The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise . The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect . God created the spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom . That ’ s what I mean by action . ” “ Should I understand the Emerald Tablet ? ” the boy asked . the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet . But you are in the desert . So immerse yourself in it . The on the face of the earth will do that . You don ’ t even have to understand the desert : all you have to do is contemplate a simple “ How do I immerse myself in the desert ? ” THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence . The approaching the area where the most violent battles were being times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears . His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence . they had made camp that day . treasure . ” when I ’ m thinking about her . ” has to say . ” boy ’ s heart began to speak of fear . It told him stories it had heard treasure and never succeeded . Sometimes it frightened the boy with satisfied : it had found love and riches . had paused to rest the horses . “ It doesn ’ t want me to go on . ” you ’ ve won . ” “ Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet . Even if and about the world . ” “ Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly . If you know your “ You will never be able to escape from your heart . So it ’ s better unanticipated blow . ” The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the suffer terribly . ” alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky . “ Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself . And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in second ’ s encounter with God and with eternity . ” was a part of the dream that I would find it . When I have been truly I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve . ” things that came from the Soul of the World . It said that all people who are happy have God within them . And that happiness could be has taken millions of years to create it . “ Everyone on earth has a want to go in search of them . We speak of them only to children . we don ’ t want people to suffer because they don ’ t follow their hearts . ” “ Why don ’ t people ’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams ? ” the boy asked the alchemist . like to suffer . ” message . understood that the boy ’ s heart had returned to the Soul of the World . “ So what should I do now ? ” the boy asked . “ And continue to pay heed to the omens . Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is . ” “ Is that the one thing I still needed to know ? ” everything that was learned along the way . It does this not because master the lessons we ’ ve learned as we ’ ve moved toward that dream . That ’ s the point at which most people give up . It ’ s the point just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon . ’ “ Every search begins with beginner ’ s luck . And every search ends with the victor ’ s being severely tested . ” The boy remembered an old proverb from his country . It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn . the alchemist were doing there . “ We ’ re going to have to search you to see whether you ’ re had searched the boy ’ s bag . The tribesman who was searching the alchemist ’ s belongings that was slightly larger than a chicken ’ s egg . “ What are these things ? ” he asked . “ That ’ s the Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life . It ’ s the Master Work of the alchemists . Whoever swallows that elixir will into gold . ” alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings . moved on . “ What did you do that for ? ” the boy ’ s heart became more and more silent . It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future ; it was content simply to was capable now of betraying the other . the desert were wearisome . His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were : his courage in having given up his sheep during the time he had worked at the crystal shop . And his heart told him something else that the boy had never he had never perceived . His heart said that one time it had hidden that the boy might wound himself . And it reminded the boy of the he had fallen into a deep sleep . There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy ’ s sheep and murder him . thinking that he had changed his route . “ Does a man ’ s heart always help him ? ” the boy asked the alchemist . “ Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their “ Does that mean that I ’ ll never run into danger ? ” said . tribes . At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield . No one paid any attention to the two travelers . the encampment . forget that you ’ re in the desert . When men are at war with one one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun . ” appeared from behind the travelers . where the tribes are at war . ” straight into the eyes of the horsemen . They were silent for a move along . The boy watched the exchange with fascination . “ You dominated alchemist . been one who stared fixedly at the two . He had been so far away that his face wasn ’ t even visible . But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them . only two days from the Pyramids . teach me about alchemy . ” “ You already know about alchemy . It is about penetrating to the reserved for you . ” into gold . ” only after they had stopped to eat . don ’ t know why . I just know that the Tradition is always right . conflict . ” But then he stopped . The alchemist probably already knew all that . thing evolves as well . “ Others stumbled upon the stone by accident . They already had of others . But they don ’ t count . They ’ re quite rare . iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill . And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own . ” The alchemist ’ s words echoed out like a curse . He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground . The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear . He had of the sea . Legend . And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water . ” Pyramids of Egypt . THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY ’ S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal . alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything . But he appeared horsemen waiting ahead of them . Before he could say anything to hundred . And then they were everywhere in the dunes . surrounding their turbans . Their faces were hidden behind blue souls . And their eyes spoke of death . THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP . A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff . “ You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago . And you were talking with one of the troops there . ” said the alchemist . “ I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes . I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here . ” “ Who is your friend ? ” the chief asked . nature . And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers . ” The boy listened quietly . And fearfully . “ What is a foreigner doing here ? ” asked another of the men . alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief . The Arab accepted them without a word . There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons . “ It ’ s a man who understands nature and the world . If he wanted knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow . Yet each felt were fearful of sorcerers . tribe . ” of the tent . But the boy couldn ’ t even speak . He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp . There was no need an impenetrable wall . “ You gave them everything I had ! ” the boy said . “ Everything I ’ ve saved in my entire life ! ” alchemist answered . “ Your money saved us for three days . It ’ s not often that money saves a person ’ s life . ” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom . He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind . He wasn ’ t an alchemist ! alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn ’ t understand . “ But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind . ” everything he needs to know . There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve : the fear of failure . ” “ I ’ m not afraid of failing . It ’ s just that I don ’ t know how to turn myself into the wind . ” “ But what if I can ’ t ? ” “ Then you ’ ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal who never even knew what their Personal Legends were . of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives . ” number of wounded were brought back to the camp . The dead of his companions . “ You could have died after peace had been who had taken his falcon out into the desert . repeated . “ Remember what I told you : the world is only the visible aspect of God . And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane . ” “ What are you doing ? ” “ Feeding my falcon . ” the boy said . “ Why feed your falcon ? ” know how to turn myself into the wind . ” camp . The sentinels allowed him to go ; they had already heard He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over sensed his fear . They both spoke the same language . himself into the wind . ” The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day . He told them all to be seated . desert . ” The boy looked out at the horizon . There were mountains in the living where survival seemed impossible . There was the desert that palm trees and three hundred wells . “ What do you want here today ? ” the desert asked him . “ Didn ’ t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday ? ” the wind . ” “ What is love ? ” the desert asked . generous to him . ” answered . “ To nourish the falcon . And the falcon then nourishes will once again flourish . That ’ s how the world goes . ” “ So is that what love is ? ” “ But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me . And that ’ s why I have to turn myself into the wind . ” The desert didn ’ t answer him for a few moments . wind . ” A breeze began to blow . The tribesmen watched the boy from a couldn ’ t understand . The alchemist smiled . The wind approached the boy and touched his face . It knew of to die . loved one to me . ” “ Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind ? ” things . ” I love . ” “ I heard what you were talking about the other day with the Personal Legend . But people can ’ t turn themselves into the wind . ” “ So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds . ” know how to turn a man into the wind . And look how many things that there were other things the wind should be able to do . wind . And it knew nothing about love . having to acknowledge its own limitations . “ Maybe it ’ s better to ask heaven . ” sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun . Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself . ” sand . The sun was turned into a golden disk . desert were already familiar with that wind . They called it the and all their weapons were filled with sand . They could barely see the boy . Their faces were covered with the “ I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind . ” But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had are not afraid . grow and the sheep to seek out shade . From where I am — and I ’ m a long way from the earth — I learned how to love . I know that if I and the Soul of the World would no longer exist . So we contemplate and it gives me my reason for living . ” great length to each other during this endless trip through the only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one . the same as gold . Each performs its own exact function as a unique that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation . the boy said . “ But you don ’ t know about love . If there hadn ’ t been a but one day that Personal Legend will be realized . So each thing has thing only . ” was in his former life . Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead ; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold . too . ” asked the boy . roam the world like the wind . And it ’ s not love to see everything become better or worse . And that ’ s where the power of love comes we are . ” “ So what do you want of me ? ” the sun asked . answered . “ But I don ’ t know how to turn you into the wind . ” and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun ’ s wisdom had its limitations . That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World . each other as they sought to keep from being blown away . speak . prayer without words or pleas . His prayer didn ’ t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures ; it didn ’ t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal ; and it didn ’ t beseech that the woman he had single emerald . He saw that omens were scattered throughout the man into the wind . Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work . it was a part of the Soul of God . And he saw that the Soul of God was THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before . For where the boy had been . But he was no longer there ; he was camp . The men were terrified at his sorcery . But there were two the glory of God . them as far as they chose . the escorts they could return to the camp . only three hours from the Pyramids . ” World . ” “ I only invoked what you already knew . ” The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery . A monk dressed in black came to the gates . They spoke for a few minutes in smiled . They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery . The which the alchemist placed in an iron pan . When the lead had and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted . The monk was irritated . The caravans had been stopped at Giza the monk said . longer lead . It was gold . “ Will I learn to do that someday ? ” the boy asked . answered . “ But I wanted to show you that it was possible . ” alchemist separated the disk into four parts . monk . “ It ’ s for your generosity to the pilgrims . ” responded . the next time . ” The alchemist turned to the boy . “ This is for you . To make up for what you gave to the general . ” The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had alchemist said to the monk . He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk . “ This is for the boy . If he ever needs it . ” close to it now . ” “ Then why this ? ” “ Because you have already lost your savings twice . Once to the happens once can never happen again . But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time . ’ ” They mounted their horses . The boy brought his horse closer . sent to the most distant regions of the empire . The other son was a and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come . The proud to know . who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot . Since he in his dream . any wish you desire . ’ son ’ s poems will be read by men for generations to come .

But any father would be proud of the to see my son ’ s words . ’ surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language . “ The man wept with happiness . angel through his tears . ‘ Can you please tell me which of my son ’ s poems these people are repeating ? ’ “ ‘ The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in words you ’ re hearing now are those of your son in the military . ’ “ The man looked at the angel in surprise . he was seeking was the Son of God . He met others who had been where the man he was looking for was visiting . ’ rabbi made ready to go to his house with him . But the centurion was he was surely in the presence of the Son of God . ’ under my roof . But only speak a word and my servant will be healed . ” ” ’ earth plays a central role in the history of the world . And normally he doesn ’ t know it . ” The boy smiled . He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd . avidly to what his heart had to say . It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden . alchemist had told him . story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful change . “ Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears . That ’ s where The boy climbed the dune slowly . A full moon rose again in the starry sky : it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis . appearance of a rolling sea ; it reminded the boy of the day when journey in search of treasure . illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the The boy fell to his knees and wept . He thanked God for making for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend . He didn ’ t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone . The everything he might have dreamed of . reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said : that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard . The boy could see now that he couldn ’ t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life . but found nothing . He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built . But he didn ’ t stop . He struggled sand back into the excavation . His hands were abraded and his tears fell . heard footsteps . Several figures approached him . Their backs were faces . “ What are you doing here ? ” one of the figures demanded . other figure said . “ What are you hiding there ? ” But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the gold . in the man ’ s eyes the boy saw death . “ He ’ s probably got more gold hidden in the ground . ” near . “ What good is money to you if you ’ re going to die ? It ’ s not often that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt . The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others : “ Leave him . He doesn ’ t have anything else . He must have stolen this gold . ” look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept . In would find a hidden treasure . But I ’ m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream . ” And they disappeared . heart bursting with joy . Because now he knew where his treasure was . EPILOGUE could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof . He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep ; it had been a peaceful night … except for the dream . He sat looking at the sky for a long time . Then he took from his looked at the stars and drank wine together . He thought of the many show him his treasure . If he hadn ’ t believed in the significance of himself . began to dig at the base of the sycamore . whole story . You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church . The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters . Couldn ’ t you have saved me from that ? ” with jewels . The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago about . The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag . He had used marketplace . His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens . He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest . They were also a It ’ s true ; life really is generous to those who pursue their to get to Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the he thought .

The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt  We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either  We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal — when it was only a step away  This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it

was not how the author of the book ended the story  transformed into a lake of salty tears  “ Why do you weep  ” the goddesses asked  contemplate his beauty close at hand  ” “ But … was Narcissus

herd at an abandoned church  The roof had fallen in long sacristy had once stood  He decided to spend the night there  He saw to it that all the across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night  searching for it  he had just finished reading as a pillow  He told himself that he made more comfortable pillows  the stars through the halfdestroyed roof  before it ended  animals also began to stir  It was as if some mysterious energy could be the other way around  that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule  But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken  name  He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said  So there were times when he read them would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields  Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed  But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days  He had been to the village only until the afternoon  So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag  behind him  each day was like all the others  The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped  It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep  “ How did you learn to read  ” the girl asked at one point  The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question  He was sure the girl would never days  He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before  the desire to live in one place forever  With the four sheep  He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year  AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same selling their wool  other places  ” But in his heart he knew that it did matter  And he knew that town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering  thought  Maybe that ’ s why they always stay close to me  The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water  seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk  and they had the boy told them about the sights of the cities  They were content nourishment  him to feel anger toward his faithful companions  He drank a bit and he gathered his jacket closer to his body  He knew that a few great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields  It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer  The jacket  But when he thought to complain about the burden of its withstood the cold of the dawn  grateful for the jacket ’ s weight and warmth  explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read  That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen  His pride for a simple farm family  They worked hard just to have food didn ’ t want to become a priest  That he wanted to travel  they leave they are basically the same people they were when they thinking that the past was better than what we have now  They have who live right here  ” boy explained  son  who travel are the shepherds  ” that held three ancient Spanish gold coins  “ I found these one day in the fields  I wanted them to be a part of women are the most beautiful  ” And he gave the boy his blessing  The boy could see in his happy  he had already seen many castles and met many women  but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence   He through those parts many times  The world was huge and inexhaustible  he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a is that they don ’ t even realize that they ’ re walking a new road every day  They don ’ t see that the fields are new and the seasons change  All they think about is food and water  thought of other women since I met the merchant ’ s daughter  had arrived there before him and asked for her hand  It ’ s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams  THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house  it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads  The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer  The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep  People said that Gypsies spent their lives always been frightened to death that he would be captured by his hands in hers  showing the old woman that he was fearful  He recited an Our Father silently  the woman sensed it  He quickly pulled his hands away  regretting having come  He thought for a moment that it would be giving too much importance to his recurrent dream  old woman  “ And dreams are the language of God  When he speaks and that ’ s what makes a shepherd ’ s life exciting  sheep are afraid of strangers  But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them  I don ’ t know why  I don ’ t know how animals know the age of human beings  ” give you a lot of time  ” both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids  ” He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were  But she said nothing  times  ” The woman was silent for some time  Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully  The boy laughed — out of happiness  He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure  your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you  ” The shepherd swore that he would  The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus  that I deserve a part of what you find  “ And this is my interpretation  you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man  ” out the old woman for this  But then he remembered that he wasn ’ t going to have to pay anything  “ I told you that your dream was a difficult one  It ’ s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary  only wise men are “ I only interpret dreams  I don ’ t know how to turn them into reality  That ’ s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with  ” “ And what if I never get to Egypt  ” “ Then I don ’ t get paid  It wouldn ’ t be the first time  ” wasted too much time with him  So the boy was disappointed  he decided that he would never again believe in dreams  He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of  he went to the market for something bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had The boy knew a lot of people in the city  That was what made need to spend all of his time with them  When someone sees the they wind up becoming a part of that person ’ s life  And then they want the person to change  If someone isn ’ t what others want them her own  He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields  Three days from He started to read the book he had bought  On the very first page it described a burial ceremony  And the names of the people reader wouldn ’ t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names  down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation  in the plaza  wanted to concentrate on his reading  who was capable of doing difficult things  He had already imagined he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front  He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared them as if they were from his personal experience  She would never hoping that the old man would leave him alone  ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches  irritating  ” “ It ’ s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in inability to choose their own Personal Legends  And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world ’ s greatest lie  ” surprised  That ’ s the world ’ s greatest lie  ” travel  ” want to return it at all  The boy noticed that the man ’ s clothing was parts  Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa  one had only to cross shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day  “ Where are you from  ” the boy asked  “ From many places  ” from a city near an ancient castle  That ’ s where I was born  ” fearing that he would appear ignorant  He looked at the people in seemed to be very busy  “ It ’ s like it always has been  ” No clue yet  But he knew that Salem wasn ’ t in Andalusia  If it “ And what do you do in Salem  ” he insisted  king of Salem  ” alone with one ’ s books  They tell their incredible stories at the time they say some things that are so strange that you don ’ t know how to continue the conversation  do you have  ” know more about his life  you ’ ve got enough sheep  ” The boy was getting irritated  He wasn ’ t asking for help  It was the conversation  sheep and get going  ” you how to find the hidden treasure  ” old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded  With a movement that was too read what the old man had written in the sand  names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he awed and embarrassed  “ For several reasons  But let ’ s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend  ” The boy didn ’ t know what a person ’ s “ Personal Legend ” was  impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend  ” None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy  But he wanted to know what the “ mysterious force ” was  the merchant ’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that  how to realize your Personal Legend  It prepares your spirit and universe  It ’ s your mission on earth  ” “ Even when all you want to do is travel  Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant  ” and jealousy  To realize one ’ s Personal Legend is a person ’ s only real obligation  All things are one  helping you to achieve it  ” townspeople  It was the old man who spoke first  “ Why do you tend a flock of sheep  ” “ Because I like to travel  ” The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at shepherds sleep out in the open  Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds  ” daughter  There was surely a baker in her town  about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends  ” as he himself had been interrupted  “ Why are you telling me all this  ” “ Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend  And you are at the point where you ’ re about to give it all up  ” “ And that ’ s when you always appear on the scene  ” people don ’ t realize I ’ ve done them  ” had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds  For five years thousands of stones looking for an emerald  The miner was about to more stone — just one more — he would find his emerald  Since the decided to become involved  He transformed himself into a stone it aside  But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone beautiful emerald in the world  The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure  flock  ” “ What about onetenth of my treasure  ” The old man looked disappointed  “ If you start out by promising toward getting it  ” The boy told him that he had already promised to give onetenth of his treasure to the Gypsy  life has its price  This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach  ” The old man returned the book to the boy  And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure  Good afternoon  ” And he vanished around the corner of the plaza  man was right  He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of the old man had said about him  Sometimes it ’ s better to leave the way things were  The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker  So he began to wander through the he knew that Egypt was in Africa  “ Can I help you  ” asked the man behind the window  strait  The idea frightened him  watching the boy walk away  “ He doesn ’ t have enough money to travel  ” years he had learned everything about shepherding  he knew how the sheep from wolves  He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia  And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals  He decided to return to his friend ’ s stable by the longest route all of Spain  the plaza where he had talked with the old man  Curse the moment I a woman who could interpret his dream  Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd  and didn ’ t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep  He knew everything about each member of his flock  he The wind began to pick up  He knew that wind  people called it the eastern end of the Mediterranean  something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted didn ’ t even remember him  He was sure that it made no difference recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises  to come and go from the baker ’ s shop  A young couple sat on the brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women  It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search that he could have the same freedom  There was nothing to hold the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend  sheep with him  sheep immediately  He said that he had always dreamed of being a almost sure to win  Beginner ’ s luck  ” “ Why is that  ” “ Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend  it whets your appetite with a taste of success  ” wool  “ Where is the treasure  ” he asked  The boy was startled  The old woman had said the same thing  But she hadn ’ t charged him anything  God has prepared a path for everyone to follow  You just have to read the omens that he left for you  ” between him and the old man  He remembered something his grandfather had once told him  that butterflies were a good omen  clovers  “ Just as your grandfather taught you  These are good omens  ” precious stones  The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day  He really was a king  He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves  black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate  “ They are called Urim and Thummim  The black question  at the Pyramids  that you already knew  But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision  ” make his own decisions  “ Don ’ t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and don ’ t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion  “ A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world  The lad wandered of the most delicious food in that part of the world  The wise man before it was his turn to be given the man ’ s attention  “ The wise man listened attentively to the boy ’ s explanation of explain the secret of happiness  He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours  to spill  ’ “ The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of returned to the room where the wise man was  that are hanging in my dining hall  Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create  Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library  ’ nothing  His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him  wise man  ‘ You cannot trust a man if you don ’ t know his house  ’ related in detail everything he had seen  “ ‘ But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you  ’ asked the wise man  gone  wisest of wise men  ‘ The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels The shepherd said nothing  He had understood the story the old never forget about his sheep  much change  All they wanted was food and water  Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out seen Abraham again after having charged him his onetenth fee  That was his work  Personal Legends  But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful  thought  I should have repeated it for him  Then when he spoke sometimes has to take some pride in himself  ” He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier  Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other  In just a few chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground  had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his kneeling at his feet  The boy felt ill and terribly alone  The infidels had an evil look about them  time  only Arabic was spoken in this country  drink that had been served at the next table  It turned out to be a bitter tea  The boy preferred wine  But he didn ’ t need to worry about that right now  What he had about getting it  The sale of his sheep had left him with enough man had known what he was talking about  during the time the boy which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky  He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a was water in the area  The sheep had taught him that  “ Who are you  ” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish  someone had appeared  “ How come you speak Spanish  ” he asked  The new arrival was a was from this city  He was about the same age and height as the boy  “ Almost everyone here speaks Spanish  We ’ re only two hours from Spain  ” ask for a glass of wine for me  I hate this tea  ” religion here forbids it  ” The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids  He payment for taking him there  He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn ’ t even have yet  “ I ’ d like you to take me there if you can  I can pay you to serve as my guide  ” “ Do you have any idea how to get there  ” the newcomer asked  listening attentively to their conversation  He felt uneasy at the out on an opportunity  enough  ” The boy thought it a strange question  But he trusted in the old universe always conspires in your favor  He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young irritated  leave  ” grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of has its thieves  ” The boy trusted his new friend  He had helped him out in a dangerous situation  He took out his money and counted it  taking the money  “ But I have to buy two camels  ” They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier  Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale  They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held  There were that would be unfriendly  He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in  than his friend  most beautiful sword he had ever seen  The scabbard was embossed to his friend  Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few he knew what he would find  He continued to look at the beautiful around  could he find his new companion  The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident  He decided to stay right there and nearby tower and began his chant  everyone in the market fell to stalls and left  houses surrounding the plaza  He recalled that when the sun had morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him where he couldn ’ t even speak the language  He was no longer a start everything over  could have changed so suddenly and so drastically  He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry  He had never even and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams  now I ’ m sad and alone  I ’ m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me  I ’ m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine  And I ’ m conquer the world  He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions  maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship  the old man had given him  had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate  He could sell the stones and buy a removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket  him was that port towns are full of thieves  Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset  he was trying to tell him not to trust that man  “ I ’ m like everyone not what actually does  ” temperature and feeling their surfaces  They were his treasure  Just handling them made him feel better  They reminded him of the old man  The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy ’ s past  read the omens  ” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment  The old man had said to ask very clear he asked if the old man ’ s blessing was still with him  He took out one of the stones  It was “ yes  ” “ Am I going to find my treasure  ” he asked  pouch and fell to the ground  The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch  He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch  But as he saw them lying said  An omen  The boy smiled to himself  He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch  He didn ’ t consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted  He so as not to flee from one ’ s own Personal Legend  “ I promised that I and that made him feel more confident  He looked around at the strange place  it was a new one  thought  Although his new world at the moment was just an empty and he would never forget it  He remembered the sword  It hurt him between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure  HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE  HE had fallen asleep in resume  He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep  he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books  He walked slowly through the market  The merchants were reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old king he had met  “ This candy merchant isn ’ t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper ’ s daughter  He ’ s doing it because it ’ s the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend  Just by looking at them  It ’ s spoken Arabic and the other Spanish  And they had understood each other perfectly well  it ’ s happening with people  He was learning a lot of new things  Some of them were things had never perceived before  And he hadn ’ t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them  He realized  If I can learn to the world  the narrow streets of Tangier  Only in that way would he be able to his sheep  that he felt every morning  He had been in the same place for thirty years  a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed  Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware  There had been a time when many people knew of his shop  Arab were always wellheeled  In those days it had been wonderful to be have beautiful women at his side as he grew older  on the hill  And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops  But the crystal merchant had no choice  He had lived thirty years to do anything else  He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on  A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop  The boy saw a man appear behind the counter  them  ” The man looked at him without responding  entered the shop and bought some crystal  merchant  laughed  requires me to feed a hungry person  ” “ Because the crystal was dirty  And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts  ” “ I ’ d like you to work in my shop  Two customers came in today really don ’ t know what they ’ re saying  Just as I hadn ’ t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep  “ Do you want to go to work for me  ” the merchant asked  The merchant laughed  “ Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year … even if you earned a good commission selling every are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there  ” There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the Pyramids  It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy ’ s that moment  The merchant looked anxiously at the boy  All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared  picked up his pouch  some sheep  ” PART TWO THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a would make him happy  The merchant spent the entire day pieces and not to break anything  some money aside  That morning he had done some calculating  if whole year to be able to buy some sheep  who pass at the bottom of the hill  ” might have died if we had come upon a snake  But that ’ s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds  ” The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses  He was selling better than ever … as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’ s major attractions  return to your sheep  Why ask more out of life  ” the merchant had never met the king  said  But the merchant understood what the boy had said  The boy ’ s having hired the boy  The boy was being paid more money than he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep  away from the business of the display  saying nothing about his dream  The treasure was now nothing but “ I don ’ t know anyone around here who would want to cross the pile of stones  You could build one in your backyard  ” wait on a customer who had entered the shop  him much  But we two have to live with our mistakes  ” “ Why did you think we should have the display  ” “ I want to get back to my sheep faster  We have to take doing to help us  It ’ s called the principle of favorability  Or beginner ’ s luck  ” during our lives  The most important is to believe only in the one He stopped there  His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law  “ What ’ s the fifth obligation  ” the boy asked  merchant answered  “ The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a holy city of Mecca  “ Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids  When I was leave someone in charge of the shop  the crystals are delicate things  pilgrimage were poorer than I  “ All who went there were happy at having done so  They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses  One of tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather  ” “ Because it ’ s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive  That ’ s on living  want to dream about Mecca  I ’ ve already imagined a thousand times seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it  I ’ ve dream about it  ” display  Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way  now able to speak their strange language  Since that morning in the because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was disembark at Tarifa as a winner  words … and about omens  One afternoon he had seen a man at the “ Let ’ s sell tea to the people who climb the hill  ” “ But we could sell tea in crystal glasses  The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses  I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men  ” “ What is it you ’ re looking for  ” asked the old merchant  earn the money to do so  ” deeply  and everything else there is to know about crystal  I know its is going to expand  And then I ’ ll have to change my way of life  ” that it hasn ’ t been too bad  The shop is exactly the size I always know how to deal with change  I ’ m used to the way I am  ” didn ’ t see before  every blessing ignored becomes a curse  I don ’ t want anything else in life  But you are forcing me to look at wealth worse than I did before you arrived  Because I know the things I thought the boy to himself  They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to himself for being able to do so  There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world  But they could never have taught him Arabic  There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can ’ t “ What does that mean  ” answered  “ But in your language it would be something like ‘ It is written  ’ ” there ’ s just no way to hold back the river  the top  But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing beautiful crystal glasses  would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware  The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers  climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old  Other shops were opened that served tea in business  and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new  THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN  IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent  especially for this day  He put his headcloth in place and secured it descended the stairs silently  The city was still sleeping  He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass  Then he sat in the sunfilled sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert  When he had It was a bundle of money  Enough to buy himself a hundred and Africa into his own country  He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop  Then the two went off to have some more tea  my sheep  And you have the money you need to go to Mecca  ” The old man said nothing  “ Will you give me your blessing  ” asked the boy  “ You have Then he turned to the boy  crystal shop  But you know that I ’ m not going to go to Mecca  Just as you know that you ’ re not going to buy your sheep  ” And he gave the boy his blessing  THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS  They filled three and Thummim  realize how long it had been since he had thought of him  For nearly aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride  omens  ” strange sensation that the old king was nearby  He had worked hard thought  Even though the sheep didn ’ t teach me to speak Arabic  But the sheep had taught him something even more important  language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying for something believed in and desired  Tangier was no longer a could conquer the world  dreams are but don ’ t want to realize them  The old king hadn ’ t told could build one in his backyard  And he had forgotten to mention The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things  He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign tea from crystal glasses  It was more activity than usual for this time the old merchant ’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king  had also been like the old king ’ s smile  trying to realize their Personal Legend  He left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant  He didn ’ t want to cry with the other people there  He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned  He was more the world  longer happy with his decision  He had worked for an entire year to becoming less important  Maybe because that wasn ’ t really his dream  Who knows … maybe it ’ s better to be like the crystal merchant  boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day tea  done  But maybe I ’ ll never have another chance to get to the an entire desert between him and the Pyramids  Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation  he was actually two hours closer to his treasure … the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn ’ t matter  all the time I need  Why not  He suddenly felt tremendously happy  He could always go back to being a shepherd  He could always become a crystal salesman anyone  He was planning as he left the bar  He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant ’ s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert  He held Urim and Thummim in to his treasure  What could it cost to go over to the supplier ’ s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away  THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of and here I am in a corral  But he had to move on  He believed in omens  All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go  He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an Work — the Philosopher ’ s Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves  He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemist had visited Europe  It was said that he was more than two Stone and the Elixir of Life  The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story  But he would never have thought it more archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers  transform any metal into gold  ” The Englishman could not contain his excitement  He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his thought  And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable  greeted the Englishman  “ Where are you bound  ” asked the young Arab  his reading  He didn ’ t want any conversation at this point  What he the alchemist would certainly put him to the test  The young Arab took out a book and began to read  The book other important things to do  burial scene that began the book  “ I ’ ve been trying for two years to concentrate  He still had some doubts about the decision he had made  But he was able to understand one thing  making a decision was only the diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision  a mystery to me  off the conversation  The boy closed his book  He felt that he didn ’ t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman  He took In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket  the earth  But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim  I didn ’ t know that they had them in this part of the world  ” “ Did you say a king  ” he asked  “ I guess you don ’ t believe that a king would talk to someone like “ Not at all  It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a surprising that kings would talk to shepherds  ” me about Urim and Thummim  These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God  The priests carried them in a golden breastplate  ” The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse  “ Who told you about omens  ” The boy ’ s interest was increasing by the moment  have to find a man who knows that universal language  An alchemist  ” The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss  leaving today for AlFayoum  ” you  ” about the words luck and coincidence  It ’ s with those words that the universal language is written  ” He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with were in search of the alchemist  regretted having said it  But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it  the warehouse boss called to them to come outside  hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me  crazy  ” belts and rifles slung on their shoulders  The Englishman had the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying  will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert  But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what  In the There was a murmur from the crowd  Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God  The boy swore to Jesus Christ  The Englishman said nothing  And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have  The people were also praying to heaven for protection  uncertainly onto their backs  The boy felt sorry for the Englishman ’ s picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse  “ I ’ m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who … ” what the Englishman was saying  The boy knew what he was about boy  The caravan moved toward the east  It traveled during the spent most of his time with his books  The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert  Now everything was quite different from mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants  and of the hoofbeats of the animals  Even the guides spoke very little to one another  remain silent  ” seems old and wise  had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face  It reminded him of the wool from his sheep … his sheep who were always had  probably already forgotten me  That ’ s good  Creatures like the probably wasn ’ t the only one  But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver ’ s comment  maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden was covered with the salt of driedup lakes  The animals balked at unburden their charges  The drivers carried the freight themselves appoint a new one  But all this happened for one basic reason  no matter how many his books  first few days of the journey  But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind  As soon as he had a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled to the driver his adventures as a shepherd  and that made me feel good  never to me  My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive children  I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed  living  So now I ’ m a camel driver  But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah  people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want  our possessions and property  But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand  ” something that the other needed — as if everything were indeed the desert  were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route  They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes  They came fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting  “ There are The three fell silent  The boy noted that there was a sense of fear experiencing the language without words … the universal language  The Englishman asked if they were in danger  including the danger  ” And he concluded by saying the mysterious word  “ Maktub  ” Englishman  “ Books are like caravans in that respect  ” The immense collection of people and animals began to travel when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — attract attention to the caravan  The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a the nocturnal cold  And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group  The Englishman was unable to sleep one night  He called to the Englishman the story of his life  The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there  World  It ’ s always a positive force  ” animal — or even just a simple thought  rarely recognize that it is working for us  But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success  ” The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands  “ I have watched the caravan as it crossed “ If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal would have been much more difficult  ” They stood there looking at the moon  speaks to the soul of the desert  ” caravan  ” that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books  all things are the manifestation of one thing only  In one of the books he learned that the most important text in inscribed on the surface of an emerald  might teach something to the boy  The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists  They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories  they believed World  This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything things communicated  They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid  “ Can ’ t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language  ” the boy asked  has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters  ” The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was alchemist from growing old  And the solid part was called the Philosopher ’ s Stone  observing the fire that purified the metals  They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world  They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves  ” The boy thought about the crystal merchant  He had said that it could free himself from negative thoughts  The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one ’ s daily life  fascinating property  A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold  ” transform everything into gold  He read the lives of the various and Geber  They were fascinating stories  each of them lived out his Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life  But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master “ WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED  ” HE asked the Englishman and missed his books  “ So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can transforming lead into gold  Gold would lose its value  middle of the desert  I ’ m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes  ” “ When were these books written  ” the boy asked  “ Many centuries ago  ” argued  “ There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy  The Englishman didn ’ t answer him directly  He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent  THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman  “ Did might be  He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war  understands that soul can also understand the language of things  I they could be written on the surface of an emerald  ” magic the strange and the laboratory equipment … none of this had made an impression on the boy  His He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags  and the sand raised by the animals  “ Everyone has his or her own THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT  THE hooded Bedouins had become a good friend of the boy ’ s — explained that the war between the tribes had already begun  The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis  themselves less and less  The silence was the worst aspect of the because it might signal a raid  the threat of war  “ Because I don ’ t live in either my past or my future  I ’ m interested only in the present  If you can concentrate always on the looked for the star they followed every night  He thought that the stars on the desert itself  “ Because we have to sleep  ” early  But the boy was quiet  He was at home with the silence of the would just be a memory  But this was the present moment — the party the camel driver had mentioned — and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future  Although could herald a miracle  as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the excitement at the arrival of the strangers  The alchemist saw the at length  But none of that mattered to the alchemist  He had already seen had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands  The dunes sands he had known since he was a child  He always enjoyed seeing Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date He decided to concentrate on more practical matters  He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets  The omens had told him so  He didn ’ t know the man He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice  I don ’ t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures  He had only one explanation for this fact  things have to be and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words  wind up forgetting the Language of the World  being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back and innumerable colored tents spread among them  impatient to meet with the alchemist  animals and people that were arriving  The men of the oasis wanted with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants  The silence of the desert was a distant world and found themselves once again in the world of people  They were relieved and happy  camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always inhabitants were women and children  There were oases leaving the oases as places of refuge  people together and gave them his instructions  The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was accommodations  That was the law of hospitality  Then he asked the men appointed by the tribal chieftains  may not shelter armies or troops  ” revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms  “ Why a revolver  ” he asked  seemed as if what the old king had called “ beginner ’ s luck ” were no constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage  So he he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path  God placed them along my path  He had surprised himself with job  He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do  driver said  ‘ Eat when it ’ s time to eat  And move along when it ’ s time to move along  ’ ” tent with five other young men of about his age  They were people tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent  outside  “ I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives  ” probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined  there were hundreds of tents  sitting down with the boy near one of the wells  The Englishman didn ’ t want to tell others about his reasons for The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water  alchemist lives here at the oasis  ” because they were married women  He should respect tradition  The Englishman was disappointed  It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing  The boy was also saddened  his friend was that ’ s what the old king had said  He couldn ’ t have been wrong  The Englishman ’ s eyes lit up  “ That ’ s it  Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is  Find out who it is who cures the people ’ s illnesses  ” insistence  Then a man approached  “ Do you know someone here who cures people ’ s illnesses  ” the boy asked  strangers  “ You ’ re looking for witch doctors  ” He spoke some verses bucket  The boy repeated his question  “ Why do you want to find that sort of person  ” the Arab asked  “ Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to  Only when he consents  “ Wait for the end of the war  Then leave with the caravan  Don ’ t But the Englishman was exultant  They were on the right track  ask about the alchemist  Soul of the World surged within him  When he looked into her dark he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart  It was love  Something older than crystals and in the silence of the desert  It was the pure Language of the World  It required no endless time  What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in than of anything in the world  He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed  But maybe people who felt that way under the sun has been written by one hand only  It is the hand that the same  “ What ’ s your name  ” he asked  “ That ’ s what some women in my country are called  ” invaders carried the name everywhere  ” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride  man who cured people ’ s illnesses  said  “ He communicates with the genies of the desert  ” The genies were the spirits of good and evil  And the girl pointed she filled her vessel with water and left  day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that she existed  He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world  asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold  I told him that was what I had come here to learn  “ He told me I should try to do so  That ’ s all he said  ‘ Go and try  ’ ” The boy didn ’ t say anything  The poor Englishman had traveled already done so many times  “ That ’ s what I ’ m going to do  I ’ m going to start now  ” water  my wife  I love you  ” “ I ’ m going to wait here for you every day  I have crossed the it brought me to you  ” The boy looked around him at the date palms  He reminded shepherd again  Fatima was more important than his treasure  if she had guessed what he was thinking  “ And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen  ” She refilled her vessel and left  The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima  He told of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him  important to both armies  It ’ s not a battle of good against evil  It ’ s a Allah is on both sides  ” went to meet with Fatima that afternoon  He told her about the become a part of you  ” more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms  “ I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time  I which men of the desert expect women to behave  Ever since I was a The boy wanted to take her hand  But Fatima ’ s hands held to the handles of her jug  it  “ That ’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal  If you have our love for each other  come back one day  ” The boy was sad as he left her that day  He thought of all the married shepherds he had known  They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields  Love required them to stay with the people they loved  hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth  They become a part of everything … they become the Soul of the World  “ Some do come back  And then the other women are happy too will be one of the women who wait  The boy went to look for the Englishman  He wanted to tell him about Fatima  He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman they had when he was reading his books  was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master But I ’ m happy at least that I didn ’ t wait twenty years  ” desert turned pink in the setting sun  He felt the urge to go out into to become hypnotized by the horizon  He tried to deal with the He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind  Although sense to the boy  It was just that he couldn ’ t grasp what it meant  He it  Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership  everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me … even the materialized over the sands of the desert  But he certainly didn ’ t desire that an army invade the oasis  meditation  He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the that wouldn ’ t allow him to do so  to occur  dangerous  observing the sunset  He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes  answered  But the boy told him about the hawks  that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World  The camel driver understood what the boy was saying  He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history means of penetration to the Soul of the World  The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World  They would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be  the future was of many things  Where was the enemy ’ s sword  Where was his horse  What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to consulted with seers  Many of them had been right about what they had ever sought out  and the one most to be feared  had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future  change those things that I don ’ t want to happen  ” said  myself for what ’ s coming  ” greatly before they even occur  ” driver had said to the seer  “ And men always live their lives based on the future  ” The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs  he threw them cloth and put them back in his bag  omens that are here in the present  guess at the future  Based on the omens of the present  The secret is The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future  that was written so as to be altered  ” thought  Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument  “ Tell them about the armies that are approaching  ” “ They ’ ll laugh at me  ” to dealing with omens  ” “ They ’ re not concerned with that right now  They believe that if someone will tell them about it  It has happened many times before  The boy thought of Fatima  And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes  THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis  “ I want to see the chieftains  I ’ ve brought omens from the desert  ” into the tent  conversation with her  boy was astonished by what he saw inside  Never could he have like this one  The ground was covered with the most beautiful resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions  Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea  Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs  The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke  which of them was the most important  an Arab dressed in white young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier  “ Who is this stranger who speaks of omens  ” asked one of the knows that we have been here for generations  ” said another of the chieftains  said  “ I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see  ” to himself  third chieftain  you don ’ t have to do anything about it  ” The men fell into an animated discussion  They spoke in an told him that something was wrong  He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert  and the boy felt better  The man hadn ’ t participated in the feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent  Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming  The discussion ended  The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying  Then he turned to the boy  this time his expression was cold and distant  know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them  ” “ We always observe the Tradition  The Tradition saved Egypt how their children should marry  The Tradition says that an oasis is vulnerable  ” No one said a word as the old man continued  “ But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert  Everything we know was taught to us by the desert  ” again  no one at the oasis may carry arms  Throughout the entire day we will once again surrender their arms to me  For every ten dead men “ But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle  Arms time they might not function  If at least one of them hasn ’ t been began to make his way there  He was alarmed by what had happened  He had succeeded in having done so might be his life  It was a frightening bet  But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day  Every day was there to be lived or to mark one ’ s departure from this world  Everything depended on one word  “ Maktub  ” silence of the desert and Fatima ’ s eyes  He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago  If he died and he was proud of that  the ground by a wind such as he had never known  The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view  Before frightening scream  what he saw  Astride the animal was a horseman dressed with a black kerchief  He appeared to be a messenger from the mere messenger  scabbard mounted on his saddle  The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon  “ Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks  ” he fifty thousand palm trees of AlFayoum  except that now the roles were reversed  I was able to see through to the Soul of the World  ” until the point touched the boy ’ s forehead  It drew a droplet of blood  sense of joy  he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend  that Soul  The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy ’ s forehead  “ Why did you read the flight of the birds  ” “ I read only what the birds wanted to tell me  They wanted to men at the oasis than you have  ” The sword remained where it was  “ Who are you to change what Allah has willed  ” taught me the language of the birds  Everything has been written by words  the boy felt immensely relieved  But he still couldn ’ t flee  of the battle  ” The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer  But he kept the sword in his hand  “ What is a stranger doing in a strange land  ” “ I am following my Personal Legend  It ’ s not something you would understand  ” relaxed  quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World  ” The boy was surprised  The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about  those who become distracted  ” What he said reminded the boy of the old king  The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip  away  The hand with the whip pointed to the south  The boy had met the alchemist  throughout the palm trees at AlFayoum  Before the sun had horizon  The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north  it hidden in their robes  When they reached the white tent at the they attacked an empty tent  The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead  The and saw nothing of what had happened  The women had remained The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion  asked him why he had violated the Tradition  The commander said return to the war  that the Tradition was sacred  He condemned the commander to desert wind  asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis  and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies  But the boy sat down and waited  Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view  He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder  Personal Legend that brings you here  ” desert  So I have come here  ” boy should enter the tent with him  It was a tent like many at the oasis  The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus mysterious designs  said the alchemist  The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen scent of the hookahs  “ Why did you want to see me  ” the boy asked  Englishman  He ’ s the one that ’ s looking for you  ” “ He has other things to do first  But he ’ s on the right track  He has begun to try to understand the desert  ” “ And what about me  ” Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend  “ So you are going to instruct me  ” “ No  You already know all you need to know  I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure  ” “ I know what ’ s happening in the desert  ” “ I also have Fatima  She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won  ” They ate in silence  The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy ’ s cup  It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted  “ Isn ’ t wine prohibited here  ” the boy asked alchemist  “ It ’ s what comes out of their mouths that is  ” under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale  everything you have learned along the way can make sense  traitorous  they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire  they are about to die  ” where there is life out in the desert  Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure  ” thought  I don ’ t know the desert that well yet  man  They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the And then the boy understood  He loosened the reins on his followed as the boy ’ s horse ran for almost half an hour  They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above alchemist ’ s eyes — the boy could see only his eyes — squinted with his effort  His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the minutes  with the snakes of the desert  The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and then he placed the snake within it  The serpent relaxed immediately  “ Why was that so important  ” “ Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert  ” The boy didn ’ t want to talk about the Pyramids  His heart was continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima  treasure  ” knows that men have to go away in order to return  And she already has her treasure  it ’ s you  Now she expects that you will find what it is you ’ re looking for  ” “ Let me tell you what will happen  You ’ ll be the counselor of the oasis  You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels  how the world is always changing  And you ’ ll get better and better there is  try to ignore them  You ’ ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants  The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do  And your camels will bring you wealth and power  she ’ ll return your love  You ’ ll remember that she never asked you to man  So you won ’ t blame her  But many times you ’ ll walk the sands could have trusted more in your love for Fatima  Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back  forever  and a great deal of merchandise  You ’ ll spend the rest of your days it ’ s too late  “ You must understand that love never keeps a man from because it wasn ’ t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World  ” slithered away among the rocks  The boy remembered the crystal Englishman in search of the alchemist  He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert  And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved  followed the alchemist back to the oasis  The wind brought the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of Legend  in his heart  response  friend enough gold to buy a sheep  Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was buy yet another sheep  sheep  Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent  The two walked out among the palms  The boy knew that it was a violation of the coming back  I love you because … ” one is loved  No reason is needed for loving  ” the entire universe conspired to help me find you  ” The two embraced  It was the first time either had touched the other  then  ” They said nothing else  They walked a bit farther among the said  He saw that Fatima ’ s eyes were filled with tears  “ You ’ re crying  ” out to do the chores she had done for years  But everything had never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday  It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three place for her  boy was following in search of his treasure  She would have to send the hope for his return  the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert  forever  ” boy said  He was already reaccustomed to the desert ’ s silence  one can always come back  If what you had found was only a on your return  ” The man was speaking the language of alchemy  But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima  It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind  The camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it  Maybe the speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to failed to observe  offered his water container to the boy  “ I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend  ” thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know  A alchemy  But I wasn ’ t able to learn anything from them  ” through action  Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey  You need to learn only one thing more  ” “ Why are you called the alchemist  ” “ Because that ’ s what I am  ” “ And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so  ” wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend  ” “ What is it that I still need to know  ” the boy asked  But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon  And finally the falcon returned with their meal  They dug a hole and lit their fire feel that they knew a better way than others had  Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today  ” “ What was written on the Emerald Tablet  ” the boy wanted to know  as if it had taken place years and years ago  The boy tried to read what was written in the sand  saw in the Englishman ’ s books  ” hawks  it can ’ t be understood by reason alone  The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World  “ The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise  The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect  God created the spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom  That ’ s what I mean by action  ” “ Should I understand the Emerald Tablet  ” the boy asked  the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet  But you are in the desert  So immerse yourself in it  The on the face of the earth will do that  You don ’ t even have to understand the desert  all you have to do is contemplate a simple “ How do I immerse myself in the desert  ” THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence  The approaching the area where the most violent battles were being times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears  His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence  they had made camp that day  treasure  ” when I ’ m thinking about her  ” has to say  ” boy ’ s heart began to speak of fear  It told him stories it had heard treasure and never succeeded  Sometimes it frightened the boy with satisfied  it had found love and riches  had paused to rest the horses  “ It doesn ’ t want me to go on  ” you ’ ve won  ” “ Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet  Even if and about the world  ” “ Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly  If you know your “ You will never be able to escape from your heart  So it ’ s better unanticipated blow  ” The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the suffer terribly  ” alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky  “ Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself  And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in second ’ s encounter with God and with eternity  ” was a part of the dream that I would find it  When I have been truly I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve  ” things that came from the Soul of the World  It said that all people who are happy have God within them  And that happiness could be has taken millions of years to create it  “ Everyone on earth has a want to go in search of them  We speak of them only to children  we don ’ t want people to suffer because they don ’ t follow their hearts  ” “ Why don ’ t people ’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams  ” the boy asked the alchemist  like to suffer  ” message  understood that the boy ’ s heart had returned to the Soul of the World  “ So what should I do now  ” the boy asked  “ And continue to pay heed to the omens  Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is  ” “ Is that the one thing I still needed to know  ” everything that was learned along the way  It does this not because master the lessons we ’ ve learned as we ’ ve moved toward that dream  That ’ s the point at which most people give up  It ’ s the point just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon  ’ “ Every search begins with beginner ’ s luck  And every search ends with the victor ’ s being severely tested  ” The boy remembered an old proverb from his country  It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn  the alchemist were doing there  “ We ’ re going to have to search you to see whether you ’ re had searched the boy ’ s bag  The tribesman who was searching the

the alchemists  Whoever swallows that elixir will into gold  ” alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings  moved on  “ What did you do that for  ” the boy ’ s heart became more and more silent  It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future  it was content simply to was capable now of betraying the other  the desert were wearisome  His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were  his courage in having given up his sheep during the time he had worked at the crystal shop  And his heart told him something else that the boy had never he had never perceived  His heart said that one time it had hidden that the boy might wound himself  And it reminded the boy of the he had fallen into a deep sleep  There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy ’ s sheep and murder him  thinking that he had changed his route  “ Does a man ’ s heart always help him  ” the boy asked the alchemist  “ Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their “ Does that mean that I ’ ll never run into danger  ” said  tribes  At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield  No one paid any attention to the two travelers  the encampment  forget that you ’ re in the desert  When men are at war with one one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun  ” appeared from behind the travelers  where the tribes are at war  ” straight into the eyes of the horsemen  They were silent for a move along  The boy watched the exchange with fascination  “ You dominated

Pyramids  teach me about alchemy  ” “ You already know about alchemy  It is about penetrating to the reserved for you  ” into gold  ” only after they had stopped to eat  don ’ t know why  I just know that the Tradition is always right  conflict  ” But then he stopped  The alchemist probably already knew all that  thing evolves as well  “ Others stumbled upon the stone by accident  They already had of others  But they don ’ t count  They ’ re quite rare  iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill  And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own  ” The alchemist ’ s words echoed out like a curse  He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground  The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear  He had of the sea  Legend  And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water  ” Pyramids of Egypt  THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY ’ S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal  alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything  But he appeared horsemen waiting ahead of them  Before he could say anything to hundred  And then they were everywhere in the dunes  surrounding their turbans  Their faces were hidden behind blue souls  And their eyes spoke of death  THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP  A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff  “ You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago  And you were talking with one of the troops there  ” said the alchemist  “ I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes  I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here  ” “ Who is your friend  ” the chief asked  nature  And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers  ” The boy listened quietly  And fearfully  “ What is a foreigner doing here  ” asked another of the men  alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief  The Arab accepted them without a word  There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons  “ It ’ s a man who understands nature and the world  If he wanted knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow  Yet each felt were fearful of sorcerers  tribe  ” of the tent  But the boy couldn ’ t even speak  He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp  There was no need an impenetrable wall  “ You gave them everything I had  ” the boy said  “ Everything I ’ ve saved in my entire life  ” alchemist answered  “ Your money saved us for three days  It ’ s not often that money saves a person ’ s life  ” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom  He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind  He wasn ’ t an alchemist  alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn ’ t understand  “ But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind  ” everything he needs to know  There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve  the fear of failure  ” “ I ’ m not afraid of failing  It ’ s just that I don ’ t know how to turn myself into the wind  ” “ But what if I can ’ t  ” “ Then you ’ ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal who never even knew what their Personal Legends were  of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives  ” number of wounded were brought back to the camp  The dead of his companions  “ You could have died after peace had been who had taken his falcon out into the desert  repeated  “ Remember what I told you  the world is only the visible aspect of God  And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane  ” “ What are you doing  ” “ Feeding my falcon  ” the boy said  “ Why feed your falcon  ” know how to turn myself into the wind  ” camp  The sentinels allowed him to go  they had already heard He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over sensed his fear  They both spoke the same language  himself into the wind  ” The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day  He told them all to be seated  desert  ” The boy looked out at the horizon  There were mountains in the living where survival seemed impossible  There was the desert that palm trees and three hundred wells  “ What do you want here today  ” the desert asked him  “ Didn ’ t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday  ” the wind  ” “ What is love  ” the desert asked  generous to him  ” answered  “ To nourish the falcon  And the falcon then nourishes will once again flourish  That ’ s how the world goes  ” “ So is that what love is  ” “ But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me  And that ’ s why I have to turn myself into the wind  ” The desert didn ’ t answer him for a few moments  wind  ” A breeze began to blow  The tribesmen watched the boy from a couldn ’ t understand  The alchemist smiled  The wind approached the boy and touched his face  It knew of to die  loved one to me  ” “ Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind  ” things  ” I love  ” “ I heard what you were talking about the other day with the Personal Legend  But people can ’ t turn themselves into the wind  ” “ So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds  ” know how to turn a man into the wind  And look how many things that there were other things the wind should be able to do  wind  And it knew nothing about love  having to acknowledge its own limitations  “ Maybe it ’ s better to ask heaven  ” sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun  Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself  ” sand  The sun was turned into a golden disk  desert were already familiar with that wind  They called it the and all their weapons were filled with sand  They could barely see the boy  Their faces were covered with the “ I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind  ” But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had are not afraid  grow and the sheep to seek out shade  From where I am — and I ’ m a long way from the earth — I learned how to love  I know that if I and the Soul of the World would no longer exist  So we contemplate and it gives me my reason for living  ” great length to each other during this endless trip through the only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one  the same as gold  Each performs its own exact function as a unique that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation  the boy said  “ But you don ’ t know about love  If there hadn ’ t been a but one day that Personal Legend will be realized  So each thing has thing only  ” was in his former life  Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead  and then lead will have to turn itself into gold  too  ” asked the boy  roam the world like the wind  And it ’ s not love to see everything become better or worse  And that ’ s where the power of love comes we are  ” “ So what do you want of me  ” the sun asked  answered  “ But I don ’ t know how to turn you into the wind  ” and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun ’ s wisdom had its limitations  That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World  each other as they sought to keep from being blown away  speak  prayer without words or pleas  His prayer didn ’ t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures  it didn ’ t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal  and it didn ’ t beseech that the woman he had single emerald  He saw that omens were scattered throughout the man into the wind  Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work  it was a part of the Soul of God  And he saw that the Soul of God was THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before  For where the boy had been  But he was no longer there  he was camp  The men were terrified at his sorcery  But there were two the glory of God  them as far as they chose  the escorts they could return to the camp  only three hours from the Pyramids  ” World  ” “ I only invoked what you already knew  ” The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery  A monk dressed in black came to the gates  They spoke for a few minutes in smiled  They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery  The which the alchemist placed in an iron pan  When the lead had and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted  The monk was irritated  The caravans had been stopped at Giza the monk said  longer lead  It was gold  “ Will I learn to do that someday  ” the boy asked  answered  “ But I wanted to show you that it was possible  ” alchemist separated the disk into four parts  monk  “ It ’ s for your generosity to the pilgrims  ” responded  the next time  ” The alchemist turned to the boy  “ This is for you  To make up for what you gave to the general  ” The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had alchemist said to the monk  He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk  “ This is for the boy  If he ever needs it  ” close to it now  ” “ Then why this  ” “ Because you have already lost your savings twice  Once to the happens once can never happen again  But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time  ’ ” They mounted their horses  The boy brought his horse closer  sent to the most distant regions of the empire  The other son was a and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come  The proud to know  who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot  Since he in his dream  any wish you desire  ’ son ’ s poems will be read by men for generations to come  I don ’ t want anything for myself  But any father would be proud of the to see my son ’ s words  ’ surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language  “ The man wept with happiness  angel through his tears  ‘ Can you please tell me which of my son ’ s poems these people are repeating  ’ “ ‘ The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in words you ’ re hearing now are those of your son in the military  ’ “ The man looked at the angel in surprise  he was seeking was the Son of God  He met others who had been where the man he was looking for was visiting  ’ rabbi made ready to go to his house with him  But the centurion was he was surely in the presence of the Son of God  ’ under my roof  But only speak a word and my servant will be healed  ” ” ’ earth plays a central role in the history of the world  And normally he doesn ’ t know it  ” The boy smiled  He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd  avidly to what his heart had to say  It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden  alchemist had told him  story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful change  “ Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears  That ’ s where The boy climbed the dune slowly  A full moon rose again in the starry sky  it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis  appearance of a rolling sea  it reminded the boy of the day when journey in search of treasure  illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the The boy fell to his knees and wept  He thanked God for making for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend  He didn ’ t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone  The everything he might have dreamed of  reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said  that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard  The boy could see now that he couldn ’ t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life  but found nothing  He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built  But he didn ’ t stop  He struggled sand back into the excavation  His hands were abraded and his tears fell  heard footsteps  Several figures approached him  Their backs were faces  “ What are you doing here  ” one of the figures demanded  other figure said  “ What are you hiding there  ” But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the gold  in the man ’ s eyes the boy saw death  “ He ’ s probably got more gold hidden in the ground  ” near  “ What good is money to you if you ’ re going to die  It ’ s not often that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt  The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others  “ Leave him  He doesn ’ t have anything else  He must have stolen this gold  ” look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept  In would find a hidden treasure  But I ’ m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream  ” And they disappeared  heart bursting with joy  Because now he knew where his treasure was  EPILOGUE could still be seen through the halfdestroyed roof  He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep  it had been a peaceful night … except for the dream  He sat looking at the sky for a long time  Then he took from his looked at the stars and drank wine together  He thought of the many show him his treasure  If he hadn ’ t believed in the significance of himself  began to dig at the base of the sycamore  whole story  You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church  The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters  Couldn ’ t you have saved me from that  ” with jewels  The spoils of a conquest that the

chest  They were also a It ’ s true  life really is generous to those who pursue their to get to Tarifa so he could give onetenth of his treasure to the he thought  Maybe it was because they moved

INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM BOOKS BY PAULO COELHO CREDITS COVER COPYRIGHT ABOUT THE PUBLISHER TEN YEARS ON I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins that said that  “ reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept  ” I struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible  Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been Roberts declaring that she adored the book  Walking alone down a The Alchemist  ” What ’ s the secret behind such a huge success  that God chose for you here on Earth  Whenever we do something we don ’ t all have the courage to confront our own dream  Why  There are four obstacles  First  we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible  We grow up calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible  But it ’ s still there  afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream  We do not realize that love is just a We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey  against the third obstacle  fear of the defeats we will meet on the didn ’ t really want it anyway  ” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is I ask myself  are defeats necessary  up eight times  only going to suffer more than other people  do — we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence  In unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives  the very next day  Then comes the fourth obstacle  the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives  Oscar Wilde said  “ Each man kills the thing he loves  ” And it ’ s true  The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt  We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either  We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal — when it was only a step away  This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it  renouncing joy and conquest  But if you and you understand why you are here  Paulo Coelho Rio de Janeiro November 2002 Translated by Margaret Jull Costa PROLOGUE Translated by Clifford E  Landers THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had Narcissus  daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty  He was so called the narcissus  But this was not how the author of the book ended the story  transformed into a lake of salty tears  “ Why do you weep  ” the goddesses asked  contemplate his beauty close at hand  ” “ But … was Narcissus beautiful  ” the lake asked  “ Who better than you to know that  ” the goddesses said in contemplate himself  ” PART ONE THE BOY ’ S NAME WAS SANTIAGO  DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church  The roof had fallen in long sacristy had once stood  He decided to spend the night there  He saw to it that all the across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night  searching for it  he had just finished reading as a pillow  He told himself that he made more comfortable pillows  the stars through the halfdestroyed roof  before it ended  animals also began to stir  It was as if some mysterious energy could be the other way around  that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule  But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken  name  He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said  So there were times when he read them would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields  Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed  But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days  He had been to the village only until the afternoon  So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag  behind him  each day was like all the others  The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped  It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep  “ How did you learn to read  ” the girl asked at one point  The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question  He was sure the girl would never days  He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before  the desire to live in one place forever  With the four sheep  He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year  AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same selling their wool  other places  ” But in his heart he knew that it did matter  And he knew that town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering  thought  Maybe that ’ s why they always stay close to me  The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water  seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk  and they had the boy told them about the sights of the cities  They were content nourishment  him to feel anger toward his faithful companions  He drank a bit and he gathered his jacket closer to his body  He knew that a few great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields  It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer  The jacket  But when he thought to complain about the burden of its withstood the cold of the dawn  grateful for the jacket ’ s weight and warmth  explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read  That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen  His pride for a simple farm family  They worked hard just to have food didn ’ t want to become a priest  That he wanted to travel  they leave they are basically the same people they were when they thinking that the past was better than what we have now  They have who live right here  ” boy explained  son  who travel are the shepherds  ” that held three ancient Spanish gold coins  “ I found these one day in the fields  I wanted them to be a part of women are the most beautiful  ” And he gave the boy his blessing  The boy could see in his happy  he had already seen many castles and met many women  but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence   He through those parts many times  The world was huge and inexhaustible  he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a is that they don ’ t even realize that they ’ re walking a new road every day  They don ’ t see that the fields are new and the seasons change  All they think about is food and water  thought of other women since I met the merchant ’ s daughter  had arrived there before him and asked for her hand  It ’ s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams  THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house  it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads  The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer  The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep  People said that Gypsies spent their lives always been frightened to death that he would be captured by his hands in hers  showing the old woman that he was fearful  He recited an Our Father silently  the woman sensed it  He quickly pulled his hands away  regretting having come  He thought for a moment that it would be giving too much importance to his recurrent dream  old woman  “ And dreams are the language of God  When he speaks and that ’ s what makes a shepherd ’ s life exciting  sheep are afraid of strangers  But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them  I don ’ t know why  I don ’ t know how animals know the age of human beings  ” give you a lot of time  ” both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids  ” He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were  But she said nothing  times  ” The woman was silent for some time  Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully  The boy laughed — out of happiness  He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure  your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you  ” The shepherd swore that he would  The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus  that I deserve a part of what you find  “ And this is my interpretation  you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man  ” out the old woman for this  But then he remembered that he wasn ’ t going to have to pay anything  “ I told you that your dream was a difficult one  It ’ s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary  only wise men are “ I only interpret dreams  I don ’ t know how to turn them into reality  That ’ s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with  ” “ And what if I never get to Egypt  ” “ Then I don ’ t get paid  It wouldn ’ t be the first time  ” wasted too much time with him  So the boy was disappointed  he decided that he would never again believe in dreams  He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of  he went to the market for something bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had The boy knew a lot of people in the city  That was what made need to spend all of his time with them  When someone sees the they wind up becoming a part of that person ’ s life  And then they want the person to change  If someone isn ’ t what others want them her own  He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields  Three days from He started to read the book he had bought  On the very first page it described a burial ceremony  And the names of the people reader wouldn ’ t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names  down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation  in the plaza  wanted to concentrate on his reading  who was capable of doing difficult things  He had already imagined he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front  He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared them as if they were from his personal experience  She would never hoping that the old man would leave him alone  ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches  irritating  ” “ It ’ s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in inability to choose their own Personal Legends  And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world ’ s greatest lie  ” surprised  That ’ s the world ’ s greatest lie  ” travel  ” want to return it at all  The boy noticed that the man ’ s clothing was parts  Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa  one had only to cross shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day  “ Where are you from  ” the boy asked  “ From many places  ” from a city near an ancient castle  That ’ s where I was born  ” fearing that he would appear ignorant  He looked at the people in seemed to be very busy  “ It ’ s like it always has been  ” No clue yet  But he knew that Salem wasn ’ t in Andalusia  If it “ And what do you do in Salem  ” he insisted  king of Salem  ” alone with one ’ s books  They tell their incredible stories at the time they say some things that are so strange that you don ’ t know how to continue the conversation  do you have  ” know more about his life  you ’ ve got enough sheep  ” The boy was getting irritated  He wasn ’ t asking for help  It was the conversation  sheep and get going  ” you how to find the hidden treasure  ” old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded  With a movement that was too read what the old man had written in the sand  names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he awed and embarrassed  “ For several reasons  But let ’ s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend  ” The boy didn ’ t know what a person ’ s “ Personal Legend ” was  impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend  ” None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy  But he wanted to know what the “ mysterious force ” was  the merchant ’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that  how to realize your Personal Legend  It prepares your spirit and universe  It ’ s your mission on earth  ” “ Even when all you want to do is travel  Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant  ” and jealousy  To realize one ’ s Personal Legend is a person ’ s only real obligation  All things are one  helping you to achieve it  ” townspeople  It was the old man who spoke first  “ Why do you tend a flock of sheep  ” “ Because I like to travel  ” The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at shepherds sleep out in the open  Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds  ” daughter  There was surely a baker in her town  about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends  ” as he himself had been interrupted  “ Why are you telling me all this  ” “ Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend  And you are at the point where you ’ re about to give it all up  ” “ And that ’ s when you always appear on the scene  ” people don ’ t realize I ’ ve done them  ” had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds  For five years thousands of stones looking for an emerald  The miner was about to more stone — just one more — he would find his emerald  Since the decided to become involved  He transformed himself into a stone it aside  But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone beautiful emerald in the world  The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure  flock  ” “ What about onetenth of my treasure  ” The old man looked disappointed  “ If you start out by promising toward getting it  ” The boy told him that he had already promised to give onetenth of his treasure to the Gypsy  life has its price  This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach  ” The old man returned the book to the boy  And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure  Good afternoon  ” And he vanished around the corner of the plaza  man was right  He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of the old man had said about him  Sometimes it ’ s better to leave the way things were  The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker  So he began to wander through the he knew that Egypt was in Africa  “ Can I help you  ” asked the man behind the window  strait  The idea frightened him  watching the boy walk away  “ He doesn ’ t have enough money to travel  ” years he had learned everything about shepherding  he knew how the sheep from wolves  He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia  And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals  He decided to return to his friend ’ s stable by the longest route all of Spain  the plaza where he had talked with the old man  Curse the moment I a woman who could interpret his dream  Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd  and didn ’ t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep  He knew everything about each member of his flock  he The wind began to pick up  He knew that wind  people called it the eastern end of the Mediterranean  something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted didn ’ t even remember him  He was sure that it made no difference recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises  to come and go from the baker ’ s shop  A young couple sat on the brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women  It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search that he could have the same freedom  There was nothing to hold the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend  sheep with him  sheep immediately  He said that he had always dreamed of being a almost sure to win  Beginner ’ s luck  ” “ Why is that  ” “ Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend  it whets your appetite with a taste of success  ” wool  “ Where is the treasure  ” he asked  The boy was startled  The old woman had said the same thing  But she hadn ’ t charged him anything  God has prepared a path for everyone to follow  You just have to read the omens that he left for you  ” between him and the old man  He remembered something his grandfather had once told him  that butterflies were a good omen  clovers  “ Just as your grandfather taught you  These are good omens  ” precious stones  The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day  He really was a king  He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves  black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate  “ They are called Urim and Thummim  The black question  at the Pyramids  that you already knew  But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision  ” make his own decisions  “ Don ’ t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and don ’ t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion  “ A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world  The lad wandered of the most delicious food in that part of the world  The wise man before it was his turn to be given the man ’ s attention  “ The wise man listened attentively to the boy ’ s explanation of explain the secret of happiness  He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours  to spill  ’ “ The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of returned to the room where the wise man was  that are hanging in my dining hall  Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create  Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library  ’ nothing  His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him  wise man  ‘ You cannot trust a man if you don ’ t know his house  ’ related in detail everything he had seen  “ ‘ But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you  ’ asked the wise man  gone  wisest of wise men  ‘ The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels The shepherd said nothing  He had understood the story the old never forget about his sheep  much change  All they wanted was food and water  Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out seen Abraham again after having charged him his onetenth fee  That was his work  Personal Legends  But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful  thought  I should have repeated it for him  Then when he spoke sometimes has to take some pride in himself  ” He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier  Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other  In just a few chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground  had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his kneeling at his feet  The boy felt ill and terribly alone  The infidels had an evil look about them  time  only Arabic was spoken in this country  drink that had been served at the next table  It turned out to be a bitter tea  The boy preferred wine  But he didn ’ t need to worry about that right now  What he had about getting it  The sale of his sheep had left him with enough man had known what he was talking about  during the time the boy which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky  He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a was water in the area  The sheep had taught him that  “ Who are you  ” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish  someone had appeared  “ How come you speak Spanish  ” he asked  The new arrival was a was from this city  He was about the same age and height as the boy  “ Almost everyone here speaks Spanish  We ’ re only two hours from Spain  ” ask for a glass of wine for me  I hate this tea  ” religion here forbids it  ” The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids  He payment for taking him there  He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn ’ t even have yet  “ I ’ d like you to take me there if you can  I can pay you to serve as my guide  ” “ Do you have any idea how to get there  ” the newcomer asked  listening attentively to their conversation  He felt uneasy at the out on an opportunity  enough  ” The boy thought it a strange question  But he trusted in the old universe always conspires in your favor  He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young irritated  leave  ” grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of has its thieves  ” The boy trusted his new friend  He had helped him out in a dangerous situation  He took out his money and counted it  taking the money  “ But I have to buy two camels  ” They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier  Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale  They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held  There were that would be unfriendly  He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in  than his friend  most beautiful sword he had ever seen  The scabbard was embossed to his friend  Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few he knew what he would find  He continued to look at the beautiful around  could he find his new companion  The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident  He decided to stay right there and nearby tower and began his chant  everyone in the market fell to stalls and left  houses surrounding the plaza  He recalled that when the sun had morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him where he couldn ’ t even speak the language  He was no longer a start everything over  could have changed so suddenly and so drastically  He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry  He had never even and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams  now I ’ m sad and alone  I ’ m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me  I ’ m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine  And I ’ m conquer the world  He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions  maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship  the old man had given him  had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate  He could sell the stones and buy a removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket  him was that port towns are full of thieves  Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset  he was trying to tell him not to trust that man  “ I ’ m like everyone not what actually does  ” temperature and feeling their surfaces  They were his treasure  Just handling them made him feel better  They reminded him of the old man  The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy ’ s past  read the omens  ” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment  The old man had said to ask very clear he asked if the old man ’ s blessing was still with him  He took out one of the stones  It was “ yes  ” “ Am I going to find my treasure  ” he asked  pouch and fell to the ground  The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch  He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch  But as he saw them lying said  An omen  The boy smiled to himself  He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch  He didn ’ t consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted  He so as not to flee from one ’ s own Personal Legend  “ I promised that I and that made him feel more confident  He looked around at the strange place  it was a new one  thought  Although his new world at the moment was just an empty and he would never forget it  He remembered the sword  It hurt him between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure  HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE  HE had fallen asleep in resume  He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep  he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books  He walked slowly through the market  The merchants were reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old king he had met  “ This candy merchant isn ’ t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper ’ s daughter  He ’ s doing it because it ’ s the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend  Just by looking at them  It ’ s spoken Arabic and the other Spanish  And they had understood each other perfectly well  it ’ s happening with people  He was learning a lot of new things  Some of them were things had never perceived before  And he hadn ’ t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them  He realized  If I can learn to the world  the narrow streets of Tangier  Only in that way would he be able to his sheep  that he felt every morning  He had been in the same place for thirty years  a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed  Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware  There had been a time when many people knew of his shop  Arab were always wellheeled  In those days it had been wonderful to be have beautiful women at his side as he grew older  on the hill  And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops  But the crystal merchant had no choice  He had lived thirty years to do anything else  He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on  A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop  The boy saw a man appear behind the counter  them  ” The man looked at him without responding  entered the shop and bought some crystal  merchant  laughed  requires me to feed a hungry person  ” “ Because the crystal was dirty  And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts  ” “ I ’ d like you to work in my shop  Two customers came in today really don ’ t know what they ’ re saying  Just as I hadn ’ t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep  “ Do you want to go to work for me  ” the merchant asked  The merchant laughed  “ Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year … even if you earned a good commission selling every are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there  ” There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the Pyramids  It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy ’ s that moment  The merchant looked anxiously at the boy  All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared  picked up his pouch  some sheep  ” PART TWO THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a would make him happy  The merchant spent the entire day pieces and not to break anything  some money aside  That morning he had done some calculating  if whole year to be able to buy some sheep  who pass at the bottom of the hill  ” might have died if we had come upon a snake  But that ’ s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds  ” The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses  He was selling better than ever … as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’ s major attractions  return to your sheep  Why ask more out of life  ” the merchant had never met the king  said  But the merchant understood what the boy had said  The boy ’ s having hired the boy  The boy was being paid more money than he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep  away from the business of the display  saying nothing about his dream  The treasure was now nothing but “ I don ’ t know anyone around here who would want to cross the pile of stones  You could build one in your backyard  ” wait on a customer who had entered the shop  him much  But we two have to live with our mistakes  ” “ Why did you think we should have the display  ” “ I want to get back to my sheep faster  We have to take doing to help us  It ’ s called the principle of favorability  Or beginner ’ s luck  ” during our lives  The most important is to believe only in the one He stopped there  His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law  “ What ’ s the fifth obligation  ” the boy asked  merchant answered  “ The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a holy city of Mecca  “ Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids  When I was leave someone in charge of the shop  the crystals are delicate things  pilgrimage were poorer than I  “ All who went there were happy at having done so  They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses  One of tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather  ” “ Because it ’ s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive  That ’ s on living  want to dream about Mecca  I ’ ve already imagined a thousand times seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it  I ’ ve dream about it  ” display  Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way  now able to speak their strange language  Since that morning in the because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was disembark at Tarifa as a winner  words … and about omens  One afternoon he had seen a man at the “ Let ’ s sell tea to the people who climb the hill  ” “ But we could sell tea in crystal glasses  The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses  I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men  ” “ What is it you ’ re looking for  ” asked the old merchant  earn the money to do so  ” deeply  and everything else there is to know about crystal  I know its is going to expand  And then I ’ ll have to change my way of life  ” that it hasn ’ t been too bad  The shop is exactly the size I always know how to deal with change  I ’ m used to the way I am  ” didn ’ t see before  every blessing ignored becomes a curse  I don ’ t want anything else in life  But you are forcing me to look at wealth worse than I did before you arrived  Because I know the things I thought the boy to himself  They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to himself for being able to do so  There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world  But they could never have taught him Arabic  There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can ’ t “ What does that mean  ” answered  “ But in your language it would be something like ‘ It is written  ’ ” there ’ s just no way to hold back the river  the top  But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing beautiful crystal glasses  would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware  The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers  climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old  Other shops were opened that served tea in business  and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new  THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN  IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent  especially for this day  He put his headcloth in place and secured it descended the stairs silently  The city was still sleeping  He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass  Then he sat in the sunfilled sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert  When he had It was a bundle of money  Enough to buy himself a hundred and Africa into his own country  He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop  Then the two went off to have some more tea  my sheep  And you have the money you need to go to Mecca  ” The old man said nothing  “ Will you give me your blessing  ” asked the boy  “ You have Then he turned to the boy  crystal shop  But you know that I ’ m not going to go to Mecca  Just as you know that you ’ re not going to buy your sheep  ” And he gave the boy his blessing  THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS  They filled three and Thummim  realize how long it had been since he had thought of him  For nearly aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride  omens  ” strange sensation that the old king was nearby  He had worked hard thought  Even though the sheep didn ’ t teach me to speak Arabic  But the sheep had taught him something even more important  language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying for something believed in and desired  Tangier was no longer a could conquer the world  dreams are but don ’ t want to realize them  The old king hadn ’ t told could build one in his backyard  And he had forgotten to mention The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things  He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign tea from crystal glasses  It was more activity than usual for this time the old merchant ’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king  had also been like the old king ’ s smile  trying to realize their Personal Legend  He left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant  He didn ’ t want to cry with the other people there  He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned  He was more the world  longer happy with his decision  He had worked for an entire year to becoming less important  Maybe because that wasn ’ t really his dream  Who knows … maybe it ’ s better to be like the crystal merchant  boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day tea  done  But maybe I ’ ll never have another chance to get to the an entire desert between him and the Pyramids  Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation  he was actually two hours closer to his treasure … the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn ’ t matter  all the time I need  Why not  He suddenly felt tremendously happy  He could always go back to being a shepherd  He could always become a crystal salesman anyone  He was planning as he left the bar  He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant ’ s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert  He held Urim and Thummim in to his treasure  What could it cost to go over to the supplier ’ s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away  THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of and here I am in a corral  But he had to move on  He believed in omens  All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go  He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an Work — the Philosopher ’ s Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves  He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemist had visited Europe  It was said that he was more than two Stone and the Elixir of Life  The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story  But he would never have thought it more archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers  transform any metal into gold  ” The Englishman could not contain his excitement  He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his thought  And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable  greeted the Englishman  “ Where are you bound  ” asked the young Arab  his reading  He didn ’ t want any conversation at this point  What he the alchemist would certainly put him to the test  The young Arab took out a book and began to read  The book other important things to do  burial scene that began the book  “ I ’ ve been trying for two years to concentrate  He still had some doubts about the decision he had made  But he was able to understand one thing  making a decision was only the diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision  a mystery to me  off the conversation  The boy closed his book  He felt that he didn ’ t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman  He took In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket  the earth  But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim  I didn ’ t know that they had them in this part of the world  ” “ Did you say a king  ” he asked  “ I guess you don ’ t believe that a king would talk to someone like “ Not at all  It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a surprising that kings would talk to shepherds  ” me about Urim and Thummim  These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God  The priests carried them in a golden breastplate  ” The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse  “ Who told you about omens  ” The boy ’ s interest was increasing by the moment  have to find a man who knows that universal language  An alchemist  ” The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss  leaving today for AlFayoum  ” you  ” about the words luck and coincidence  It ’ s with those words that the universal language is written  ” He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with were in search of the alchemist  regretted having said it  But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it  the warehouse boss called to them to come outside  hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me  crazy  ” belts and rifles slung on their shoulders  The Englishman had the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying  will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert  But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what  In the There was a murmur from the crowd  Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God  The boy swore to Jesus Christ  The Englishman said nothing  And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have  The people were also praying to heaven for protection  uncertainly onto their backs  The boy felt sorry for the Englishman ’ s picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse  “ I ’ m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who … ” what the Englishman was saying  The boy knew what he was about boy  The caravan moved toward the east  It traveled during the spent most of his time with his books  The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert  Now everything was quite different from mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants  and of the hoofbeats of the animals  Even the guides spoke very little to one another  remain silent  ” seems old and wise  had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face  It reminded him of the wool from his sheep … his sheep who were always had  probably already forgotten me  That ’ s good  Creatures like the probably wasn ’ t the only one  But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver ’ s comment  maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden was covered with the salt of driedup lakes  The animals balked at unburden their charges  The drivers carried the freight themselves appoint a new one  But all this happened for one basic reason  no matter how many his books  first few days of the journey  But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind  As soon as he had a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled to the driver his adventures as a shepherd  and that made me feel good  never to me  My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive children  I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed  living  So now I ’ m a camel driver  But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah  people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want  our possessions and property  But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand  ” something that the other needed — as if everything were indeed the desert  were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route  They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes  They came fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting  “ There are The three fell silent  The boy noted that there was a sense of fear experiencing the language without words … the universal language  The Englishman asked if they were in danger  including the danger  ” And he concluded by saying the mysterious word  “ Maktub  ” Englishman  “ Books are like caravans in that respect  ” The immense collection of people and animals began to travel when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — attract attention to the caravan  The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a the nocturnal cold  And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group  The Englishman was unable to sleep one night  He called to the Englishman the story of his life  The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there  World  It ’ s always a positive force  ” animal — or even just a simple thought  rarely recognize that it is working for us  But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success  ” The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands  “ I have watched the caravan as it crossed “ If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal would have been much more difficult  ” They stood there looking at the moon  speaks to the soul of the desert  ” caravan  ” that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books  all things are the manifestation of one thing only  In one of the books he learned that the most important text in inscribed on the surface of an emerald  might teach something to the boy  The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists  They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories  they believed World  This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything things communicated  They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid  “ Can ’ t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language  ” the boy asked  has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters  ” The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was alchemist from growing old  And the solid part was called the Philosopher ’ s Stone  observing the fire that purified the metals  They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world  They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves  ” The boy thought about the crystal merchant  He had said that it could free himself from negative thoughts  The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one ’ s daily life  fascinating property  A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold  ” transform everything into gold  He read the lives of the various and Geber  They were fascinating stories  each of them lived out his Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life  But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master “ WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED  ” HE asked the Englishman and missed his books  “ So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can transforming lead into gold  Gold would lose its value  middle of the desert  I ’ m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes  ” “ When were these books written  ” the boy asked  “ Many centuries ago  ” argued  “ There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy  The Englishman didn ’ t answer him directly  He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent  THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman  “ Did might be  He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war  understands that soul can also understand the language of things  I they could be written on the surface of an emerald  ” magic the strange and the laboratory equipment … none of this had made an impression on the boy  His He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags  and the sand raised by the animals  “ Everyone has his or her own THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT  THE hooded Bedouins had become a good friend of the boy ’ s — explained that the war between the tribes had already begun  The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis  themselves less and less  The silence was the worst aspect of the because it might signal a raid  the threat of war  “ Because I don ’ t live in either my past or my future  I ’ m interested only in the present  If you can concentrate always on the looked for the star they followed every night  He thought that the stars on the desert itself  “ Because we have to sleep  ” early  But the boy was quiet  He was at home with the silence of the would just be a memory  But this was the present moment — the party the camel driver had mentioned — and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future  Although could herald a miracle  as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the excitement at the arrival of the strangers  The alchemist saw the at length  But none of that mattered to the alchemist  He had already seen had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands  The dunes sands he had known since he was a child  He always enjoyed seeing Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date He decided to concentrate on more practical matters  He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets  The omens had told him so  He didn ’ t know the man He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice  I don ’ t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures  He had only one explanation for this fact  things have to be and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words  wind up forgetting the Language of the World  being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back and innumerable colored tents spread among them  impatient to meet with the alchemist  animals and people that were arriving  The men of the oasis wanted with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants  The silence of the desert was a distant world and found themselves once again in the world of people  They were relieved and happy  camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always inhabitants were women and children  There were oases leaving the oases as places of refuge  people together and gave them his instructions  The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was accommodations  That was the law of hospitality  Then he asked the men appointed by the tribal chieftains  may not shelter armies or troops  ” revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms  “ Why a revolver  ” he asked  seemed as if what the old king had called “ beginner ’ s luck ” were no constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage  So he he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path  God placed them along my path  He had surprised himself with job  He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do  driver said  ‘ Eat when it ’ s time to eat  And move along when it ’ s time to move along  ’ ” tent with five other young men of about his age  They were people tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent  outside  “ I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives  ” probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined  there were hundreds of tents  sitting down with the boy near one of the wells  The Englishman didn ’ t want to tell others about his reasons for The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water  alchemist lives here at the oasis  ” because they were married women  He should respect tradition  The Englishman was disappointed  It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing  The boy was also saddened  his friend was that ’ s what the old king had said  He couldn ’ t have been wrong  The Englishman ’ s eyes lit up  “ That ’ s it  Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is  Find out who it is who cures the people ’ s illnesses  ” insistence  Then a man approached  “ Do you know someone here who cures people ’ s illnesses  ” the boy asked  strangers  “ You ’ re looking for witch doctors  ” He spoke some verses bucket  The boy repeated his question  “ Why do you want to find that sort of person  ” the Arab asked  “ Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to  Only when he consents  “ Wait for the end of the war  Then leave with the caravan  Don ’ t But the Englishman was exultant  They were on the right track  ask about the alchemist  Soul of the World surged within him  When he looked into her dark he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart  It was love  Something older than crystals and in the silence of the desert  It was the pure Language of the World  It required no endless time  What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in than of anything in the world  He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed  But maybe people who felt that way under the sun has been written by one hand only  It is the hand that the same  “ What ’ s your name  ” he asked  “ That ’ s what some women in my country are called  ” invaders carried the name everywhere  ” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride  man who cured people ’ s illnesses  said  “ He communicates with the genies of the desert  ” The genies were the spirits of good and evil  And the girl pointed she filled her vessel with water and left  day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that she existed  He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world  asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold  I told him that was what I had come here to learn  “ He told me I should try to do so  That ’ s all he said  ‘ Go and try  ’ ” The boy didn ’ t say anything  The poor Englishman had traveled already done so many times  “ That ’ s what I ’ m going to do  I ’ m going to start now  ” water  my wife  I love you  ” “ I ’ m going to wait here for you every day  I have crossed the it brought me to you  ” The boy looked around him at the date palms  He reminded shepherd again  Fatima was more important than his treasure  if she had guessed what he was thinking  “ And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen  ” She refilled her vessel and left  The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima  He told of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him  important to both armies  It ’ s not a battle of good against evil  It ’ s a Allah is on both sides  ” went to meet with Fatima that afternoon  He told her about the become a part of you  ” more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms  “ I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time  I which men of the desert expect women to behave  Ever since I was a The boy wanted to take her hand  But Fatima ’ s hands held to the handles of her jug  it  “ That ’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal  If you have our love for each other  come back one day  ” The boy was sad as he left her that day  He thought of all the married shepherds he had known  They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields  Love required them to stay with the people they loved  hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth  They become a part of everything … they become the Soul of the World  “ Some do come back  And then the other women are happy too will be one of the women who wait  The boy went to look for the Englishman  He wanted to tell him about Fatima  He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman they had when he was reading his books  was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master But I ’ m happy at least that I didn ’ t wait twenty years  ” desert turned pink in the setting sun  He felt the urge to go out into to become hypnotized by the horizon  He tried to deal with the He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind  Although sense to the boy  It was just that he couldn ’ t grasp what it meant  He it  Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership  everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me … even the materialized over the sands of the desert  But he certainly didn ’ t desire that an army invade the oasis  meditation  He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the that wouldn ’ t allow him to do so  to occur  dangerous  observing the sunset  He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes  answered  But the boy told him about the hawks  that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World  The camel driver understood what the boy was saying  He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history means of penetration to the Soul of the World  The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World  They would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be  the future was of many things  Where was the enemy ’ s sword  Where was his horse  What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to consulted with seers  Many of them had been right about what they had ever sought out  and the one most to be feared  had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future  change those things that I don ’ t want to happen  ” said  myself for what ’ s coming  ” greatly before they even occur  ” driver had said to the seer  “ And men always live their lives based on the future  ” The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs  he threw them cloth and put them back in his bag  omens that are here in the present  guess at the future  Based on the omens of the present  The secret is The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future  that was written so as to be altered  ” thought  Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument  “ Tell them about the armies that are approaching  ” “ They ’ ll laugh at me  ” to dealing with omens  ” “ They ’ re not concerned with that right now  They believe that if someone will tell them about it  It has happened many times before  The boy thought of Fatima  And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes  THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis  “ I want to see the chieftains  I ’ ve brought omens from the desert  ” into the tent  conversation with her  boy was astonished by what he saw inside  Never could he have like this one  The ground was covered with the most beautiful resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions  Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea  Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs  The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke  which of them was the most important  an Arab dressed in white young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier  “ Who is this stranger who speaks of omens  ” asked one of the knows that we have been here for generations  ” said another of the chieftains  said  “ I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see  ” to himself  third chieftain  you don ’ t have to do anything about it  ” The men fell into an animated discussion  They spoke in an told him that something was wrong  He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert  and the boy felt better  The man hadn ’ t participated in the feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent  Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming  The discussion ended  The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying  Then he turned to the boy  this time his expression was cold and distant  know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them  ” “ We always observe the Tradition  The Tradition saved Egypt how their children should marry  The Tradition says that an oasis is vulnerable  ” No one said a word as the old man continued  “ But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert  Everything we know was taught to us by the desert  ” again  no one at the oasis may carry arms  Throughout the entire day we will once again surrender their arms to me  For every ten dead men “ But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle  Arms time they might not function  If at least one of them hasn ’ t been began to make his way there  He was alarmed by what had happened  He had succeeded in having done so might be his life  It was a frightening bet  But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day  Every day was there to be lived or to mark one ’ s departure from this world  Everything depended on one word  “ Maktub  ” silence of the desert and Fatima ’ s eyes  He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago  If he died and he was proud of that  the ground by a wind such as he had never known  The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view  Before frightening scream  what he saw  Astride the animal was a horseman dressed with a black kerchief  He appeared to be a messenger from the mere messenger  scabbard mounted on his saddle  The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon  “ Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks  ” he fifty thousand palm trees of AlFayoum  except that now the roles were reversed  I was able to see through to the Soul of the World  ” until the point touched the boy ’ s forehead  It drew a droplet of blood  sense of joy  he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend  that Soul  The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy ’ s forehead  “ Why did you read the flight of the birds  ” “ I read only what the birds wanted to tell me  They wanted to men at the oasis than you have  ” The sword remained where it was  “ Who are you to change what Allah has willed  ” taught me the language of the birds  Everything has been written by words  the boy felt immensely relieved  But he still couldn ’ t flee  of the battle  ” The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer  But he kept the sword in his hand  “ What is a stranger doing in a strange land  ” “ I am following my Personal Legend  It ’ s not something you would understand  ” relaxed  quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World  ” The boy was surprised  The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about  those who become distracted  ” What he said reminded the boy of the old king  The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip  away  The hand with the whip pointed to the south  The boy had met the alchemist  throughout the palm trees at AlFayoum  Before the sun had horizon  The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north  it hidden in their robes  When they reached the white tent at the they attacked an empty tent  The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead  The and saw nothing of what had happened  The women had remained The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion  asked him why he had violated the Tradition  The commander said return to the war  that the Tradition was sacred  He condemned the commander to desert wind  asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis  and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies  But the boy sat down and waited  Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view  He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder  Personal Legend that brings you here  ” desert  So I have come here  ” boy should enter the tent with him  It was a tent like many at the oasis  The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus mysterious designs  said the alchemist  The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen scent of the hookahs  “ Why did you want to see me  ” the boy asked  Englishman  He ’ s the one that ’ s looking for you  ” “ He has other things to do first  But he ’ s on the right track  He has begun to try to understand the desert  ” “ And what about me  ” Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend  “ So you are going to instruct me  ” “ No  You already know all you need to know  I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure  ” “ I know what ’ s happening in the desert  ” “ I also have Fatima  She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won  ” They ate in silence  The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy ’ s cup  It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted  “ Isn ’ t wine prohibited here  ” the boy asked alchemist  “ It ’ s what comes out of their mouths that is  ” under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale  everything you have learned along the way can make sense  traitorous  they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire  they are about to die  ” where there is life out in the desert  Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure  ” thought  I don ’ t know the desert that well yet  man  They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the And then the boy understood  He loosened the reins on his followed as the boy ’ s horse ran for almost half an hour  They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above alchemist ’ s eyes — the boy could see only his eyes — squinted with his effort  His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the minutes  with the snakes of the desert  The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and then he placed the snake within it  The serpent relaxed immediately  “ Why was that so important  ” “ Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert  ” The boy didn ’ t want to talk about the Pyramids  His heart was continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima  treasure  ” knows that men have to go away in order to return  And she already has her treasure  it ’ s you  Now she expects that you will find what it is you ’ re looking for  ” “ Let me tell you what will happen  You ’ ll be the counselor of the oasis  You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels  how the world is always changing  And you ’ ll get better and better there is  try to ignore them  You ’ ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants  The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do  And your camels will bring you wealth and power  she ’ ll return your love  You ’ ll remember that she never asked you to man  So you won ’ t blame her  But many times you ’ ll walk the sands could have trusted more in your love for Fatima  Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back  forever  and a great deal of merchandise  You ’ ll spend the rest of your days it ’ s too late  “ You must understand that love never keeps a man from because it wasn ’ t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World  ” slithered away among the rocks  The boy remembered the crystal Englishman in search of the alchemist  He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert  And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved  followed the alchemist back to the oasis  The wind brought the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of Legend  in his heart  response  friend enough gold to buy a sheep  Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was buy yet another sheep  sheep  Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent  The two walked out among the palms  The boy knew that it was a violation of the coming back  I love you because … ” one is loved  No reason is needed for loving  ” the entire universe conspired to help me find you  ” The two embraced  It was the first time either had touched the other  then  ” They said nothing else  They walked a bit farther among the said  He saw that Fatima ’ s eyes were filled with tears  “ You ’ re crying  ” out to do the chores she had done for years  But everything had never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday  It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three place for her  boy was following in search of his treasure  She would have to send the hope for his return  the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert  forever  ” boy said  He was already reaccustomed to the desert ’ s silence  one can always come back  If what you had found was only a on your return  ” The man was speaking the language of alchemy  But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima  It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind  The camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it  Maybe the speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to failed to observe  offered his water container to the boy  “ I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend  ” thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know  A alchemy  But I wasn ’ t able to learn anything from them  ” through action  Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey  You need to learn only one thing more  ” “ Why are you called the alchemist  ” “ Because that ’ s what I am  ” “ And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so  ” wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend  ” “ What is it that I still need to know  ” the boy asked  But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon  And finally the falcon returned with their meal  They dug a hole and lit their fire feel that they knew a better way than others had  Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today  ” “ What was written on the Emerald Tablet  ” the boy wanted to know  as if it had taken place years and years ago  The boy tried to read what was written in the sand  saw in the Englishman ’ s books  ” hawks  it can ’ t be understood by reason alone  The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World  “ The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise  The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect  God created the spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom  That ’ s what I mean by action  ” “ Should I understand the Emerald Tablet  ” the boy asked  the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet  But you are in the desert  So immerse yourself in it  The on the face of the earth will do that  You don ’ t even have to understand the desert  all you have to do is contemplate a simple “ How do I immerse myself in the desert  ” THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence  The approaching the area where the most violent battles were being times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears  His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence  they had made camp that day  treasure  ” when I ’ m thinking about her  ” has to say  ” boy ’ s heart began to speak of fear  It told him stories it had heard treasure and never succeeded  Sometimes it frightened the boy with satisfied  it had found love and riches  had paused to rest the horses  “ It doesn ’ t want me to go on  ” you ’ ve won  ” “ Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet  Even if and about the world  ” “ Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly  If you know your “ You will never be able to escape from your heart  So it ’ s better unanticipated blow  ” The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the suffer terribly  ” alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky  “ Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself  And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in second ’ s encounter with God and with eternity  ” was a part of the dream that I would find it  When I have been truly I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve  ” things that came from the Soul of the World  It said that all people who are happy have God within them  And that happiness could be has taken millions of years to create it  “ Everyone on earth has a want to go in search of them  We speak of them only to children  we don ’ t want people to suffer because they don ’ t follow their hearts  ” “ Why don ’ t people ’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams  ” the boy asked the alchemist  like to suffer  ” message  understood that the boy ’ s heart had returned to the Soul of the World  “ So what should I do now  ” the boy asked  “ And continue to pay heed to the omens  Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is  ” “ Is that the one thing I still needed to know  ” everything that was learned along the way  It does this not because master the lessons we ’ ve learned as we ’ ve moved toward that dream  That ’ s the point at which most people give up  It ’ s the point just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon  ’ “ Every search begins with beginner ’ s luck  And every search ends with the victor ’ s being severely tested  ” The boy remembered an old proverb from his country  It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn  the alchemist were doing there  “ We ’ re going to have to search you to see whether you ’ re had searched the boy ’ s bag  The tribesman who was searching the alchemist ’ s belongings that was slightly larger than a chicken ’ s egg  “ What are these things  ” he asked  “ That ’ s the Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life  It ’ s the Master Work of the alchemists  Whoever swallows that elixir will into gold  ” alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings  moved on  “ What did you do that for  ” the boy ’ s heart became more and more silent  It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future  it was content simply to was capable now of betraying the other  the desert were wearisome  His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were  his courage in having given up his sheep during the time he had worked at the crystal shop  And his heart told him something else that the boy had never he had never perceived  His heart said that one time it had hidden that the boy might wound himself  And it reminded the boy of the he had fallen into a deep sleep  There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy ’ s sheep and murder him  thinking that he had changed his route  “ Does a man ’ s heart always help him  ” the boy asked the alchemist  “ Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their “ Does that mean that I ’ ll never run into danger  ” said  tribes  At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield  No one paid any attention to the two travelers  the encampment  forget that you ’ re in the desert  When men are at war with one one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun  ” appeared from behind the travelers  where the tribes are at war  ” straight into the eyes of the horsemen  They were silent for a move along  The boy watched the exchange with fascination  “ You dominated alchemist  been one who stared fixedly at the two  He had been so far away that his face wasn ’ t even visible  But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them  only two days from the Pyramids  teach me about alchemy  ” “ You already know about alchemy  It is about penetrating to the reserved for you  ” into gold  ” only after they had stopped to eat  don ’ t know why  I just know that the Tradition is always right  conflict  ” But then he stopped  The alchemist probably already knew all that  thing evolves as well  “ Others stumbled upon the stone by accident  They already had of others  But they don ’ t count  They ’ re quite rare  iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill  And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own  ” The alchemist ’ s words echoed out like a curse  He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground  The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear  He had of the sea  Legend  And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water  ” Pyramids of Egypt  THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY ’ S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal  alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything  But he appeared horsemen waiting ahead of them  Before he could say anything to hundred  And then they were everywhere in the dunes  surrounding their turbans  Their faces were hidden behind blue souls  And their eyes spoke of death  THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP  A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff  “ You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago  And you were talking with one of the troops there  ” said the alchemist  “ I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes  I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here  ” “ Who is your friend  ” the chief asked  nature  And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers  ” The boy listened quietly  And fearfully  “ What is a foreigner doing here  ” asked another of the men  alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief  The Arab accepted them without a word  There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons  “ It ’ s a man who understands nature and the world  If he wanted knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow  Yet each felt were fearful of sorcerers  tribe  ” of the tent  But the boy couldn ’ t even speak  He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp  There was no need an impenetrable wall  “ You gave them everything I had  ” the boy said  “ Everything I ’ ve saved in my entire life  ” alchemist answered  “ Your money saved us for three days  It ’ s not often that money saves a person ’ s life  ” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom  He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind  He wasn ’ t an alchemist  alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn ’ t understand  “ But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind  ” everything he needs to know  There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve  the fear of failure  ” “ I ’ m not afraid of failing  It ’ s just that I don ’ t know how to turn myself into the wind  ” “ But what if I can ’ t  ” “ Then you ’ ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal who never even knew what their Personal Legends were  of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives  ” number of wounded were brought back to the camp  The dead of his companions  “ You could have died after peace had been who had taken his falcon out into the desert  repeated  “ Remember what I told you  the world is only the visible aspect of God  And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane  ” “ What are you doing  ” “ Feeding my falcon  ” the boy said  “ Why feed your falcon  ” know how to turn myself into the wind  ” camp  The sentinels allowed him to go  they had already heard He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over sensed his fear  They both spoke the same language  himself into the wind  ” The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day  He told them all to be seated  desert  ” The boy looked out at the horizon  There were mountains in the living where survival seemed impossible  There was the desert that palm trees and three hundred wells  “ What do you want here today  ” the desert asked him  “ Didn ’ t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday  ” the wind  ” “ What is love  ” the desert asked  generous to him  ” answered  “ To nourish the falcon  And the falcon then nourishes will once again flourish  That ’ s how the world goes  ” “ So is that what love is  ” “ But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me  And that ’ s why I have to turn myself into the wind  ” The desert didn ’ t answer him for a few moments  wind  ” A breeze began to blow  The tribesmen watched the boy from a couldn ’ t understand  The alchemist smiled  The wind approached the boy and touched his face  It knew of to die  loved one to me  ” “ Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind  ” things  ” I love  ” “ I heard what you were talking about the other day with the Personal Legend  But people can ’ t turn themselves into the wind  ” “ So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds  ” know how to turn a man into the wind  And look how many things that there were other things the wind should be able to do  wind  And it knew nothing about love  having to acknowledge its own limitations  “ Maybe it ’ s better to ask heaven  ” sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun  Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself  ” sand  The sun was turned into a golden disk  desert were already familiar with that wind  They called it the and all their weapons were filled with sand  They could barely see the boy  Their faces were covered with the “ I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind  ” But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had are not afraid  grow and the sheep to seek out shade  From where I am — and I ’ m a long way from the earth — I learned how to love  I know that if I and the Soul of the World would no longer exist  So we contemplate and it gives me my reason for living  ” great length to each other during this endless trip through the only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one  the same as gold  Each performs its own exact function as a unique that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation  the boy said  “ But you don ’ t know about love  If there hadn ’ t been a but one day that Personal Legend will be realized  So each thing has thing only  ” was in his former life  Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead  and then lead will have to turn itself into gold  too  ” asked the boy  roam the world like the wind  And it ’ s not love to see everything become better or worse  And that ’ s where the power of love comes we are  ” “ So what do you want of me  ” the sun asked  answered  “ But I don ’ t know how to turn you into the wind  ” and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun ’ s wisdom had its limitations  That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World  each other as they sought to keep from being blown away  speak  prayer without words or pleas  His prayer didn ’ t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures  it didn ’ t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal  and it didn ’ t beseech that the woman he had single emerald  He saw that omens were scattered throughout the man into the wind  Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work  it was a part of the Soul of God  And he saw that the Soul of God was THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before  For where the boy had been  But he was no longer there  he was camp  The men were terrified at his sorcery  But there were two the glory of God  them as far as they chose  the escorts they could return to the camp  only three hours from the Pyramids  ” World  ” “ I only invoked what you already knew  ” The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery  A monk dressed in black came to the gates  They spoke for a few minutes in smiled  They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery  The which the

was gold  “ Will I learn to do that someday  ” the boy asked  answered  “ But I wanted to show you that it was possible  ” alchemist separated the disk into four parts  monk  “ It ’ s for your generosity to the pilgrims  ” responded  the next time  ” The alchemist turned to the boy  “ This is for you  To make up for what you gave to the general  ” The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had alchemist said to the monk  He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk  “ This is for the boy  If he ever needs it  ” close to it now  ” “ Then why this  ” “ Because you have already lost your savings twice  Once to the happens once can never happen again  But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time  ’ ” They mounted their horses  The boy brought his horse closer  sent to the most distant regions of the empire  The other son was a and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come  The proud to know  who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot  Since he in his dream  any wish you desire  ’ son ’ s poems will be read by men for generations to come  I don ’ t want anything for myself  But any father would be proud of the to see my son ’ s words  ’ surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language  “ The man wept with happiness  angel through his tears  ‘ Can you please tell me which of my son ’ s poems these people are repeating  ’ “ ‘ The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in words you ’ re hearing now are those of your son in the military  ’ “ The man looked at the angel in surprise  he was seeking was the Son of God  He met others who had been where the man he was looking for was visiting  ’ rabbi made ready to go to his house with him  But the centurion was he was surely in the presence of the Son of God  ’ under my roof  But only speak a word and my servant will be healed  ” ” ’ earth plays a central role in the history of the world  And normally he doesn ’ t know it  ” The boy smiled  He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd  avidly to what his heart had to say  It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden  alchemist had told him  story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful change  “ Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears  That ’ s where The boy climbed the dune slowly  A full moon rose again in the starry sky  it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis  appearance of a rolling sea  it reminded the boy of the day when journey in search of treasure  illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the The boy fell to his knees and wept  He thanked God for making for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend  He didn ’ t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone  The everything he might have dreamed of  reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said  that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard  The boy could see now that he couldn ’ t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life  but found nothing  He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built  But he didn ’ t stop  He struggled sand back into the excavation  His hands were abraded and his tears fell  heard footsteps  Several figures approached him  Their backs were faces  “ What are you doing here  ” one of the figures demanded  other figure said  “ What are you hiding there  ” But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the gold  in the man ’ s eyes the boy saw death  “ He ’ s probably got more gold hidden in the ground  ” near  “ What good is money to you if you ’ re going to die  It ’ s not often that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt  The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others  “ Leave him  He doesn ’ t have anything else  He must have stolen this gold  ” look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept  In would find a hidden treasure  But I ’ m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream  ” And they disappeared  heart bursting with joy  Because now he knew where his treasure was  EPILOGUE could still be seen through the halfdestroyed roof  He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep  it had been a peaceful night … except for the dream  He sat looking at the sky for a long time  Then he took from his looked at the stars and drank wine together  He thought of the many show him his treasure  If he hadn ’ t believed in the significance of himself  began to dig at the base of the sycamore  whole story  You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church  The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters  Couldn ’ t you have saved me from that  ” with jewels  The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago about  The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag  He had used marketplace  His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens  He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest  They were also a It ’ s true  life really is generous to those who pursue their to get to Tarifa so he could give onetenth of his treasure to the he thought  Maybe it was because they moved

CLARKE Contents INTRODUCTION I remember receiving a letter from the American publisher Harper Collins … PROLOGUE The alchemist picked up a book that someone in the … ONE The boy ’ s name was Santiago . Dusk was falling as the … TWO The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for … EPILOGUE church just as night … ABOUT THE AUTHOR INTERNATIONAL ACCLAIM BOOKS BY PAULO COELHO CREDITS COVER COPYRIGHT ABOUT THE PUBLISHER TEN YEARS ON I REMEMBER RECEIVING A LETTER FROM THE AMERICAN publisher Harper Collins that said that : “ reading The Alchemist was like getting up at dawn and seeing the sun rise while the rest of the world still slept . ” I struggling to establish myself as a writer and to follow my path despite all the voices telling me it was impossible . Brazilian journalist phoned to say that President Clinton had been Roberts declaring that she adored the book . Walking alone down a The Alchemist ! ” What ’ s the secret behind such a huge success ? that God chose for you here on Earth . Whenever we do something we don ’ t all have the courage to confront our own dream . Why ? There are four obstacles . First : we are told from childhood onward that everything we want to do is impossible . We grow up calling is so deeply buried in our soul as to be invisible . But it ’ s still there . afraid of hurting those around us by abandoning everything in order to pursue our dream . We do not realize that love is just a We do not realize that those who genuinely wish us well want us to be happy and are prepared to accompany us on that journey . against the third obstacle : fear of the defeats we will meet on the didn ’ t really want it anyway . ” We do want it and know that we have staked everything on it and that the path of the personal calling is patience in difficult times and to know that the Universe is I ask myself : are defeats necessary ? up eight times . only going to suffer more than other people ? do — we are filled by a greater sense of euphoria and confidence . In unexpected suffering passes more quickly than suffering that is to free ourselves from the bitterness and it stays with us for the rest of our lives . the very next day . Then comes the fourth obstacle : the fear of realizing the dream for which we fought all our lives . Oscar Wilde said : “ Each man kills the thing he loves . ” And it ’ s true . The mere possibility of getting what we want fills the soul of the ordinary person with guilt . We look around at all those who have failed to get what they want and feel that we do not deserve to get what we want either . We forget about all the obstacles we series of stupid mistakes and never reached their goal — when it was only a step away . This is the most dangerous of the obstacles because it has a kind of saintly aura about it : renouncing joy and conquest . But if you and you understand why you are here . Paulo Coelho Rio de Janeiro November 2002 Translated by Margaret Jull Costa PROLOGUE Translated by Clifford E . Landers THE ALCHEMIST PICKED UP A BOOK THAT SOMEONE IN THE caravan had Narcissus . daily beside a lake to contemplate his own beauty . He was so called the narcissus . But this was not how the author of the book ended the story . transformed into a lake of salty tears . “ Why do you weep ? ” the goddesses asked . contemplate his beauty close at hand . ” “ But … was Narcissus beautiful ? ” the lake asked . “ Who better than you to know that ? ” the goddesses said in contemplate himself ! ” PART ONE THE BOY ’ S NAME WAS SANTIAGO . DUSK WAS FALLING AS the boy arrived with his herd at an abandoned church . The roof had fallen in long sacristy had once stood . He decided to spend the night there . He saw to it that all the across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night . searching for it . he had just finished reading as a pillow . He told himself that he made more comfortable pillows . the stars through the half-destroyed roof . before it ended . animals also began to stir . It was as if some mysterious energy could be the other way around : that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule . But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken . name . He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said . So there were times when he read them would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields . Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed . But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one they would reach in about four days . He had been to the village only until the afternoon . So the boy sat on the steps of the shop and took a book from his bag . behind him . each day was like all the others . The shepherd told her of the where he had stopped . It was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep . “ How did you learn to read ? ” the girl asked at one point . The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question . He was sure the girl would never days . He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before : the desire to live in one place forever . With the four sheep . He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year . AND NOW IT WAS ONLY FOUR DAYS BEFORE HE WOULD BE back in that same selling their wool . other places . ” But in his heart he knew that it did matter . And he knew that town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering . thought . Maybe that ’ s why they always stay close to me . The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water . seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk ; and they had the boy told them about the sights of the cities . They were content nourishment . him to feel anger toward his faithful companions . He drank a bit and he gathered his jacket closer to his body . He knew that a few great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields . It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer . The jacket . But when he thought to complain about the burden of its withstood the cold of the dawn . grateful for the jacket ’ s weight and warmth . explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read . That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen . His pride for a simple farm family . They worked hard just to have food didn ’ t want to become a priest . That he wanted to travel . they leave they are basically the same people they were when they thinking that the past was better than what we have now . They have who live right here . ” boy explained . son . who travel are the shepherds . ” that held three ancient Spanish gold coins . “ I found these one day in the fields . I wanted them to be a part of women are the most beautiful . ” And he gave the boy his blessing . The boy could see in his happy ; he had already seen many castles and met many women ( but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence ) . He through those parts many times . The world was huge and inexhaustible ; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a is that they don ’ t even realize that they ’ re walking a new road every day . They don ’ t see that the fields are new and the seasons change . All they think about is food and water . thought of other women since I met the merchant ’ s daughter . had arrived there before him and asked for her hand . It ’ s the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life there was an old woman who interpreted dreams . THE OLD WOMAN LED THE BOY TO A ROOM AT THE BACK of her house ; it was separated from her living room by a curtain of colored beads . The It sounded like a Gypsy prayer . The boy had already had had no flocks of sheep . People said that Gypsies spent their lives always been frightened to death that he would be captured by his hands in hers . showing the old woman that he was fearful . He recited an Our Father silently . the woman sensed it . He quickly pulled his hands away . regretting having come . He thought for a moment that it would be giving too much importance to his recurrent dream . old woman . “ And dreams are the language of God . When he speaks and that ’ s what makes a shepherd ’ s life exciting . sheep are afraid of strangers . But children always seem to be able to play with them without frightening them . I don ’ t know why . I don ’ t know how animals know the age of human beings . ” give you a lot of time . ” both hands and transported me to the Egyptian pyramids . ” He paused for a moment to see if the woman knew what the Egyptian pyramids were . But she said nothing . times . ” The woman was silent for some time . Then she again took his hands and studied them carefully . The boy laughed — out of happiness . He was going to be able to save the little money he had because of a dream about hidden treasure ! your treasure in exchange for what I am going to tell you . ” The shepherd swore that he would . The old woman asked him to swear again while looking at the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus . that I deserve a part of what you find . “ And this is my interpretation : you must go to the Pyramids in you a rich man . ” out the old woman for this ! But then he remembered that he wasn ’ t going to have to pay anything . “ I told you that your dream was a difficult one . It ’ s the simple things in life that are the most extraordinary ; only wise men are “ I only interpret dreams . I don ’ t know how to turn them into reality . That ’ s why I have to live off what my daughters provide me with . ” “ And what if I never get to Egypt ? ” “ Then I don ’ t get paid . It wouldn ’ t be the first time . ” wasted too much time with him . So the boy was disappointed ; he decided that he would never again believe in dreams . He remembered that he had a number of things he had to take care of : he went to the market for something bench in the plaza where he could sample the new wine he had The boy knew a lot of people in the city . That was what made need to spend all of his time with them . When someone sees the they wind up becoming a part of that person ’ s life . And then they want the person to change . If someone isn ’ t what others want them her own . He decided to wait until the sun had sunk a bit lower in the sky before following his flock back through the fields . Three days from He started to read the book he had bought . On the very first page it described a burial ceremony . And the names of the people reader wouldn ’ t have to worry about memorizing a lot of names . down at his side and tried to strike up a conversation . in the plaza . wanted to concentrate on his reading . who was capable of doing difficult things . He had already imagined he explained that the sheep had to be sheared from back to front . He also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared them as if they were from his personal experience . She would never hoping that the old man would leave him alone . ashamed and decide of his own accord to change benches . irritating . ” “ It ’ s a book that says the same thing almost all the other books in inability to choose their own Personal Legends . And it ends up saying that everyone believes the world ’ s greatest lie . ” surprised . That ’ s the world ’ s greatest lie . ” travel . ” want to return it at all . The boy noticed that the man ’ s clothing was parts . Africa was only a few hours from Tarifa ; one had only to cross shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day . “ Where are you from ? ” the boy asked . “ From many places . ” from a city near an ancient castle . That ’ s where I was born . ” fearing that he would appear ignorant . He looked at the people in seemed to be very busy . “ It ’ s like it always has been . ” No clue yet . But he knew that Salem wasn ’ t in Andalusia . If it “ And what do you do in Salem ? ” he insisted . king of Salem ! ” alone with one ’ s books . They tell their incredible stories at the time they say some things that are so strange that you don ’ t know how to continue the conversation . do you have ? ” know more about his life . you ’ ve got enough sheep . ” The boy was getting irritated . He wasn ’ t asking for help . It was the conversation . sheep and get going . ” you how to find the hidden treasure . ” old man — maybe he was her husband — was going to find a way to get much more money in exchange for information about something Something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded . With a movement that was too read what the old man had written in the sand . names of his father and his mother and the name of the seminary he awed and embarrassed . “ For several reasons . But let ’ s say that the most important is that you have succeeded in discovering your Personal Legend . ” The boy didn ’ t know what a person ’ s “ Personal Legend ” was . impossible for them to realize their Personal Legend . ” None of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy . But he wanted to know what the “ mysterious force ” was ; the merchant ’ s daughter would be impressed when he told her about that ! how to realize your Personal Legend . It prepares your spirit and universe . It ’ s your mission on earth . ” “ Even when all you want to do is travel ? Or marry the daughter of a textile merchant ? ” and jealousy . To realize one ’ s Personal Legend is a person ’ s only real obligation . All things are one . helping you to achieve it . ” townspeople . It was the old man who spoke first . “ Why do you tend a flock of sheep ? ” “ Because I like to travel . ” The old man pointed to a baker standing in his shop window at shepherds sleep out in the open . Parents would rather see their children marry bakers than shepherds . ” daughter . There was surely a baker in her town . about shepherds and bakers becomes more important for them than their own Personal Legends . ” as he himself had been interrupted . “ Why are you telling me all this ? ” “ Because you are trying to realize your Personal Legend . And you are at the point where you ’ re about to give it all up . ” “ And that ’ s when you always appear on the scene ? ” people don ’ t realize I ’ ve done them . ” had abandoned everything to go mining for emeralds . For five years thousands of stones looking for an emerald . The miner was about to more stone — just one more — he would find his emerald . Since the decided to become involved . He transformed himself into a stone it aside . But he had thrown it with such force that it broke the stone beautiful emerald in the world . The boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure . flock . ” “ What about one-tenth of my treasure ? ” The old man looked disappointed . “ If you start out by promising toward getting it . ” The boy told him that he had already promised to give one-tenth of his treasure to the Gypsy . life has its price . This is what the Warriors of the Light try to teach . ” The old man returned the book to the boy . And I will tell you how to find the hidden treasure . Good afternoon . ” And he vanished around the corner of the plaza . man was right . He went over to the bakery and bought a loaf of the old man had said about him . Sometimes it ’ s better to leave the way things were . The boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker . So he began to wander through the he knew that Egypt was in Africa . “ Can I help you ? ” asked the man behind the window . strait . The idea frightened him . watching the boy walk away . “ He doesn ’ t have enough money to travel . ” years he had learned everything about shepherding : he knew how the sheep from wolves . He knew all the fields and pastures of Andalusia . And he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals . He decided to return to his friend ’ s stable by the longest route all of Spain . the plaza where he had talked with the old man . Curse the moment I a woman who could interpret his dream . Neither the woman nor the old man was at all impressed by the fact that he was a shepherd . and didn ’ t understand that shepherds become attached to their sheep . He knew everything about each member of his flock : he The wind began to pick up . He knew that wind : people called it the eastern end of the Mediterranean . something he had become accustomed to and something he wanted didn ’ t even remember him . He was sure that it made no difference recognize the good things that happen in their lives every day that the sun rises . to come and go from the baker ’ s shop . A young couple sat on the brought the smell of the desert and of veiled women . It had brought with it the sweat and the dreams of men who had once left to search that he could have the same freedom . There was nothing to hold the fields of Andalusia were only steps along the way to his Personal Legend . sheep with him . sheep immediately . He said that he had always dreamed of being a almost sure to win . Beginner ’ s luck . ” “ Why is that ? ” “ Because there is a force that wants you to realize your Personal Legend ; it whets your appetite with a taste of success . ” wool . “ Where is the treasure ? ” he asked . The boy was startled . The old woman had said the same thing . But she hadn ’ t charged him anything . God has prepared a path for everyone to follow . You just have to read the omens that he left for you . ” between him and the old man . He remembered something his grandfather had once told him : that butterflies were a good omen . clovers . “ Just as your grandfather taught you . These are good omens . ” precious stones . The boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day . He really was a king ! He must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves . black stone that had been embedded at the center of the breastplate . “ They are called Urim and Thummim . The black question . at the Pyramids ; that you already knew . But I had to insist on the payment of six sheep because I helped you to make your decision . ” make his own decisions . “ Don ’ t forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and don ’ t forget to follow your Personal Legend through to its conclusion . “ A certain shopkeeper sent his son to learn about the secret of happiness from the wisest man in the world . The lad wandered of the most delicious food in that part of the world . The wise man before it was his turn to be given the man ’ s attention . “ The wise man listened attentively to the boy ’ s explanation of explain the secret of happiness . He suggested that the boy look around the palace and return in two hours . to spill . ’ “ The boy began climbing and descending the many stairways of returned to the room where the wise man was . that are hanging in my dining hall ? Did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create ? Did you notice the beautiful parchments in my library ? ’ nothing . His only concern had been not to spill the oil that the wise man had entrusted to him . wise man . ‘ You cannot trust a man if you don ’ t know his house . ’ related in detail everything he had seen . “ ‘ But where are the drops of oil I entrusted to you ? ’ asked the wise man . gone . wisest of wise men . ‘ The secret of happiness is to see all the marvels The shepherd said nothing .

Melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out seen Abraham again after having charged him his one-tenth fee . That was his work . Personal Legends . But the king of Salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful . thought . I should have repeated it for him . Then when he spoke sometimes has to take some pride in himself . ” He was sitting in a bar very much like the other bars he had seen along the narrow streets of Tangier . Some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other . In just a few chanted — as everyone about him went to their knees and placed their foreheads on the ground . had always looked at the image of Saint Santiago Matamoros on his kneeling at his feet . The boy felt ill and terribly alone . The infidels had an evil look about them . time : only Arabic was spoken in this country . drink that had been served at the next table . It turned out to be a bitter tea . The boy preferred wine . But he didn ’ t need to worry about that right now . What he had about getting it . The sale of his sheep had left him with enough man had known what he was talking about : during the time the boy which path he should take by observing the ground and the sky . He had discovered that the presence of a certain bird meant that a was water in the area . The sheep had taught him that . “ Who are you ? ” he heard a voice ask him in Spanish . someone had appeared . “ How come you speak Spanish ? ” he asked . The new arrival was a was from this city . He was about the same age and height as the boy . “ Almost everyone here speaks Spanish . We ’ re only two hours from Spain . ” ask for a glass of wine for me . I hate this tea . ” religion here forbids it . ” The boy told him then that he needed to get to the Pyramids . He payment for taking him there . He remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn ’ t even have yet . “ I ’ d like you to take me there if you can . I can pay you to serve as my guide . ” “ Do you have any idea how to get there ? ” the newcomer asked . listening attentively to their conversation . He felt uneasy at the out on an opportunity . enough . ” The boy thought it a strange question . But he trusted in the old universe always conspires in your favor . He took his money from his pouch and showed it to the young irritated . leave . ” grabbed him and began to speak to him in an angry stream of has its thieves . ” The boy trusted his new friend . He had helped him out in a dangerous situation . He took out his money and counted it . taking the money . “ But I have to buy two camels . ” They walked together through the narrow streets of Tangier . Everywhere there were stalls with items for sale . They reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held . There were that would be unfriendly . He knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in . than his friend . most beautiful sword he had ever seen . The scabbard was embossed to his friend . Then he realized that he had been distracted for a few he knew what he would find . He continued to look at the beautiful around . could he find his new companion . The boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident . He decided to stay right there and nearby tower and began his chant ; everyone in the market fell to stalls and left . houses surrounding the plaza . He recalled that when the sun had morning he had known everything that was going to happen to him where he couldn ’ t even speak the language . He was no longer a start everything over . could have changed so suddenly and so drastically . He was so ashamed that he wanted to cry . He had never even and because this was the way God repaid those who believed in their dreams . now I ’ m sad and alone . I ’ m going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me . I ’ m going to hate those who have found their treasure because I never found mine . And I ’ m conquer the world . He opened his pouch to see what was left of his possessions ; maybe there was a bit left of the sandwich he had eaten on the ship . the old man had given him . had exchanged six sheep for two precious stones that had been taken from a gold breastplate . He could sell the stones and buy a removing them from the pouch so he could put them in his pocket . him was that port towns are full of thieves . Now he understood why the owner of the bar had been so upset : he was trying to tell him not to trust that man . “ I ’ m like everyone not what actually does . ” temperature and feeling their surfaces . They were his treasure . Just handling them made him feel better . They reminded him of the old man . The boy was trying to understand the truth of what the old man stones were proof that he had met with a king — a king who knew of the boy ’ s past . read the omens . ” The boy put the stones back in the pouch and decided to do an experiment . The old man had said to ask very clear he asked if the old man ’ s blessing was still with him . He took out one of the stones . It was “ yes . ” “ Am I going to find my treasure ? ” he asked . pouch and fell to the ground . The boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch . He knelt down to find Urim and Thummim and put them back in the pouch . But as he saw them lying said . An omen . The boy smiled to himself . He picked up the two stones and put them back in his pouch . He didn ’ t consider mending the hole — the stones could fall through any time they wanted . He so as not to flee from one ’ s own Personal Legend . “ I promised that I and that made him feel more confident . He looked around at the strange place ; it was a new one . thought . Although his new world at the moment was just an empty and he would never forget it . He remembered the sword . It hurt him between thinking of himself as the poor victim of a thief and as an adventurer in quest of his treasure . HE WAS SHAKEN INTO WAKEFULNESS BY SOMEONE . HE had fallen asleep in resume . He no longer had to seek out food and water for the sheep ; he could as much an adventurer as the ones he had admired in books . He walked slowly through the market . The merchants were reminded the boy of the old man — the mysterious old king he had met . “ This candy merchant isn ’ t making candy so that later he can travel or marry a shopkeeper ’ s daughter . He ’ s doing it because it ’ s the same thing the old man had done — sense whether a person was near to or far from his Personal Legend . Just by looking at them . It ’ s spoken Arabic and the other Spanish . And they had understood each other perfectly well . it ’ s happening with people . He was learning a lot of new things . Some of them were things had never perceived before . And he hadn ’ t perceived them because he had become accustomed to them . He realized : If I can learn to the world . the narrow streets of Tangier . Only in that way would he be able to his sheep . that he felt every morning . He had been in the same place for thirty years : a shop at the top of a hilly street where few customers passed . Now it was too late to change anything — the only thing he had ever learned to do was to buy and sell crystal glassware . There had been a time when many people knew of his shop : Arab were always well-heeled . In those days it had been wonderful to be have beautiful women at his side as he grew older . on the hill . And no one was going to climb the hill just to browse through a few small shops . But the crystal merchant had no choice . He had lived thirty years to do anything else . He spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings practiced eyes of the crystal merchant could see that the boy had no lunch for a few minutes until the boy moved on . A CARD HANGING IN THE DOORWAY ANNOUNCED THAT several languages were spoken in the shop . The boy saw a man appear behind the counter . them . ” The man looked at him without responding . entered the shop and bought some crystal . merchant . laughed . requires me to feed a hungry person . ” “ Because the crystal was dirty . And both you and I needed to cleanse our minds of negative thoughts . ” “ I ’ d like you to work in my shop . Two customers came in today really don ’ t know what they ’ re saying . Just as I hadn ’ t realized that for so many years I had been speaking a language without words to my sheep . “ Do you want to go to work for me ? ” the merchant asked . The merchant laughed . “ Even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year … even if you earned a good commission selling every are thousands of kilometers of desert between here and there . ” There was a moment of silence so profound that it seemed the Pyramids . It was as if the world had fallen silent because the boy ’ s that moment . The merchant looked anxiously at the boy . All the joy he had seen that morning had suddenly disappeared . picked up his pouch . some sheep . ” PART TWO THE BOY HAD BEEN WORKING FOR THE CRYSTAL MERCHANT for almost a would make him happy . The merchant spent the entire day pieces and not to break anything . some money aside . That morning he had done some calculating : if whole year to be able to buy some sheep . who pass at the bottom of the hill . ” might have died if we had come upon a snake . But that ’ s the way life is with sheep and with shepherds . ” The merchant turned to a customer who wanted three crystal glasses . He was selling better than ever … as if time had turned back to the old days when the street had been one of Tangier ’ s major attractions . return to your sheep . Why ask more out of life ? ” the merchant had never met the king . said . But the merchant understood what the boy had said . The boy ’ s having hired the boy . The boy was being paid more money than he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep . away from the business of the display . saying nothing about his dream . The treasure was now nothing but “ I don ’ t know anyone around here who would want to cross the pile of stones . You could build one in your backyard . ” wait on a customer who had entered the shop . him much . But we two have to live with our mistakes . ” “ Why did you think we should have the display ? ” “ I want to get back to my sheep faster . We have to take doing to help us . It ’ s called the principle of favorability . Or beginner ’ s luck . ” during our lives . The most important is to believe only in the one He stopped there . His eyes filled with tears as he spoke of the wanted to live his life in accordance with Muslim law . “ What ’ s the fifth obligation ? ” the boy asked . merchant answered . “ The fifth obligation of every Muslim is a holy city of Mecca . “ Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids . When I was leave someone in charge of the shop ; the crystals are delicate things . pilgrimage were poorer than I . “ All who went there were happy at having done so . They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses . One of tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather . ” “ Because it ’ s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive . That ’ s on living . want to dream about Mecca . I ’ ve already imagined a thousand times seven times I walk around it before allowing myself to touch it . I ’ ve dream about it . ” display . Not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way . now able to speak their strange language . Since that morning in the because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was disembark at Tarifa as a winner . words … and about omens . One afternoon he had seen a man at the “ Let ’ s sell tea to the people who climb the hill . ” “ But we could sell tea in crystal glasses . The people will enjoy the tea and want to buy the glasses . I have been told that beauty is the great seducer of men . ” “ What is it you ’ re looking for ? ” asked the old merchant . earn the money to do so . ” deeply . and everything else there is to know about crystal . I know its is going to expand . And then I ’ ll have to change my way of life . ” that it hasn ’ t been too bad . The shop is exactly the size I always know how to deal with change . I ’ m used to the way I am . ” didn ’ t see before : every blessing ignored becomes a curse . I don ’ t want anything else in life . But you are forcing me to look at wealth worse than I did before you arrived . Because I know the things I thought the boy to himself . They went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to himself for being able to do so . There had been a time when he thought that his sheep could teach him everything he needed to know about the world . But they could never have taught him Arabic . There are probably other things in the world that the sheep can ’ t “ What does that mean ? ” answered . “ But in your language it would be something like ‘ It is written . ’ ” there ’ s just no way to hold back the river . the top . But there they saw a crystal shop that offered refreshing beautiful crystal glasses . would be impressed by the beauty of the glassware . The other man remarked that tea was always more delicious when it was served in tradition in the Orient to use crystal glasses for tea because it had magical powers . climb the hill to see the shop that was doing something new in a trade that was so old . Other shops were opened that served tea in business . and his shop was sought out by men and women with a thirst for things new . THE BOY AWOKE BEFORE DAWN . IT HAD BEEN ELEVEN months and nine days since he had first set foot on the African continent . especially for this day . He put his headcloth in place and secured it descended the stairs silently . The city was still sleeping . He prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass . Then he sat in the sun-filled sound of the wind that brought the scent of the desert . When he had It was a bundle of money . Enough to buy himself a hundred and Africa into his own country . He waited patiently for the merchant to awaken and open the shop . Then the two went off to have some more tea . my sheep . And you have the money you need to go to Mecca . ” The old man said nothing . “ Will you give me your blessing ? ” asked the boy . “ You have Then he turned to the boy . crystal shop . But you know that I ’ m not going to go to Mecca . Just as you know that you ’ re not going to buy your sheep . ” And he gave the boy his blessing . THE BOY WENT TO HIS ROOM AND PACKED HIS BELONGINGS . They filled three and Thummim . realize how long it had been since he had thought of him . For nearly aside enough money so that he could return to Spain with pride . omens . ” strange sensation that the old king was nearby . He had worked hard thought . Even though the sheep didn ’ t teach me to speak Arabic . But the sheep had taught him something even more important : language the boy had used throughout the time that he was trying for something believed in and desired . Tangier was no longer a could conquer the world . dreams are but don ’ t want to realize them . The old king hadn ’ t told could build one in his backyard . And he had forgotten to mention The boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things . He went down the stairs and found the merchant waiting on a foreign tea from crystal glasses . It was more activity than usual for this time the old merchant ’ s hair was very much like the hair of the old king . had also been like the old king ’ s smile . trying to realize their Personal Legend . He left without saying good-bye to the crystal merchant . He didn ’ t want to cry with the other people there . He was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned . He was more the world . longer happy with his decision . He had worked for an entire year to becoming less important . Maybe because that wasn ’ t really his dream . Who knows … maybe it ’ s better to be like the crystal merchant : boy thought — he came to the bar he had entered on his first day tea . done . But maybe I ’ ll never have another chance to get to the an entire desert between him and the Pyramids . Yet the boy felt that there was another way to regard his situation : he was actually two hours closer to his treasure … the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn ’ t matter . all the time I need . Why not ? He suddenly felt tremendously happy . He could always go back to being a shepherd . He could always become a crystal salesman anyone ! He was planning as he left the bar . He had remembered that one of the crystal merchant ’ s suppliers transported his crystal by means of caravans that crossed the desert . He held Urim and Thummim in to his treasure . What could it cost to go over to the supplier ’ s warehouse and find out if the Pyramids were really that far away ? THE ENGLISHMAN WAS SITTING ON A BENCH IN A STRUCTURE that smelled of and here I am in a corral . But he had to move on . He believed in omens . All his life and all his studies were aimed at finding the one true language of the but his studies had taken him to a point beyond which he could not seem to go . He had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an Work — the Philosopher ’ s Stone — and for this reason kept their knowledge to themselves . He had already spent much of the fortune left to him by his had purchased all the rarest and most important volumes on alchemist had visited Europe . It was said that he was more than two Stone and the Elixir of Life . The Englishman had been profoundly impressed by the story . But he would never have thought it more archaeological expedition in the desert — told him about an Arab that was possessed of exceptional powers . transform any metal into gold . ” The Englishman could not contain his excitement . He canceled all his commitments and pulled together the most important of his thought . And the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable . greeted the Englishman . “ Where are you bound ? ” asked the young Arab . his reading . He didn ’ t want any conversation at this point . What he the alchemist would certainly put him to the test . The young Arab took out a book and began to read . The book other important things to do . burial scene that began the book . “ I ’ ve been trying for two years to concentrate . He still had some doubts about the decision he had made . But he was able to understand one thing : making a decision was only the diving into a strong current that will carry him to places he had never dreamed of when he first made the decision . a mystery to me . off the conversation . The boy closed his book . He felt that he didn ’ t want to do anything that might make him look like the Englishman . He took In a flash the boy put them back in his pocket . the earth . But those who know about such things would know that those are Urim and Thummim . I didn ’ t know that they had them in this part of the world . ” “ Did you say a king ? ” he asked . “ I guess you don ’ t believe that a king would talk to someone like “ Not at all . It was shepherds who were the first to recognize a surprising that kings would talk to shepherds . ” me about Urim and Thummim . These stones were the only form of divination permitted by God . The priests carried them in a golden breastplate . ” The boy was suddenly happy to be there at the warehouse . “ Who told you about omens ? ” The boy ’ s interest was increasing by the moment . have to find a man who knows that universal language . An alchemist . ” The conversation was interrupted by the warehouse boss . leaving today for Al-Fayoum . ” you ? ” about the words luck and coincidence . It ’ s with those words that the universal language is written . ” He told the boy it was no coincidence that he had met him with were in search of the alchemist . regretted having said it . But the Englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it . the warehouse boss called to them to come outside . hold the power of life and death for every person I take with me . crazy . ” belts and rifles slung on their shoulders . The Englishman had the leader had to repeat himself several times for everyone to understand what he was saying . will do everything possible once again to win out over the desert . But I want each and every one of you to swear by the God you believe in that you will follow my orders no matter what . In the There was a murmur from the crowd . Each was swearing quietly to his or her own God . The boy swore to Jesus Christ . The Englishman said nothing . And the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have . The people were also praying to heaven for protection . uncertainly onto their backs . The boy felt sorry for the Englishman ’ s picking up the conversation where it had been interrupted in the warehouse . “ I ’ m here because a friend of mine heard of an Arab who … ” what the Englishman was saying . The boy knew what he was about boy . The caravan moved toward the east . It traveled during the spent most of his time with his books . The boy observed in silence the progress of the animals and people across the desert . Now everything was quite different from mixed with the nervous orders of the guides and the merchants . and of the hoofbeats of the animals . Even the guides spoke very little to one another . remain silent . ” seems old and wise . had sat at the fort in Tarifa with this same wind blowing in his face . It reminded him of the wool from his sheep … his sheep who were always had . probably already forgotten me . That ’ s good . Creatures like the probably wasn ’ t the only one . But he was excited at his intuitive understanding of the camel driver ’ s comment : maybe he was also learning the universal language that deals with the past and the boy was beginning to understand that intuition is really a sudden was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes . The animals balked at unburden their charges . The drivers carried the freight themselves appoint a new one . But all this happened for one basic reason : no matter how many his books . first few days of the journey . But he found it much more interesting to observe the caravan and listen to the wind . As soon as he had a superstition that each time he opened the book he would learn He became friendly with the camel driver who traveled to the driver his adventures as a shepherd . and that made me feel good . never to me . My neighbors feared they would lose all their olive children . I thought that everything I owned would be destroyed . living . So now I ’ m a camel driver . But that disaster taught me to understand the word of Allah : people need not fear the unknown if they are capable of achieving what they need and want . our possessions and property . But this fear evaporates when we understand that our life stories and the history of the world were written by the same hand . ” something that the other needed — as if everything were indeed the desert . were Bedouins who did surveillance along the caravan route . They provided warnings about thieves and barbarian tribes . They came fire where the Englishman and the boy were sitting . “ There are The three fell silent . The boy noted that there was a sense of fear experiencing the language without words … the universal language . The Englishman asked if they were in danger . including the danger . ” And he concluded by saying the mysterious word : “ Maktub . ” Englishman . “ Books are like caravans in that respect . ” The immense collection of people and animals began to travel when the travelers were accustomed to talking around the fires — attract attention to the caravan . The travelers adopted the practice of arranging the animals in a the nocturnal cold . And the leader posted armed sentinels at the fringes of the group . The Englishman was unable to sleep one night . He called to the Englishman the story of his life . The Englishman was fascinated with the part about the progress achieved at the crystal shop after the boy began working there . World . It ’ s always a positive force . ” animal — or even just a simple thought . rarely recognize that it is working for us . But in the crystal shop you probably realized that even the glasses were collaborating in your success . ” The boy thought about that for a while as he looked at the moon and the bleached sands . “ I have watched the caravan as it crossed “ If either of us had joined this caravan based only on personal would have been much more difficult . ” They stood there looking at the moon . speaks to the soul of the desert . ” caravan . ” that seemed to repeat itself throughout all the books : all things are the manifestation of one thing only . In one of the books he learned that the most important text in inscribed on the surface of an emerald . might teach something to the boy . The book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists . They were men who had dedicated their entire lives to the purification of metals in their laboratories ; they believed World . This Soul of the World allowed them to understand anything things communicated . They called that discovery the Master Work — it was part liquid and part solid . “ Can ’ t you just observe men and omens in order to understand the language ? ” the boy asked . has to be followed exactly as it was followed by the masters . ” The boy learned that the liquid part of the Master Work was alchemist from growing old . And the solid part was called the Philosopher ’ s Stone . observing the fire that purified the metals . They spent so much time close to the fire that gradually they gave up the vanities of the world . They discovered that the purification of the metals had led to a purification of themselves . ” The boy thought about the crystal merchant . He had said that it could free himself from negative thoughts . The boy was becoming more and more convinced that alchemy could be learned in one ’ s daily life . fascinating property . A small sliver of the stone can transform large quantities of metal into gold . ” transform everything into gold . He read the lives of the various and Geber . They were fascinating stories : each of them lived out his Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life . But when the boy wanted to learn how to achieve the Master “ WHY DO THEY MAKE THINGS SO COMPLICATED ? ” HE asked the Englishman and missed his books . “ So that those who have the responsibility for understanding can transforming lead into gold . Gold would lose its value . middle of the desert . I ’ m seeking a true alchemist who will help me to decipher the codes . ” “ When were these books written ? ” the boy asked . “ Many centuries ago . ” argued . “ There was no way for everybody to know about alchemy . The Englishman didn ’ t answer him directly . He said that for the past few days he had been paying attention to how the caravan he had noticed was that talk of war was becoming more and more frequent . THEN ONE DAY THE BOY RETURNED THE BOOKS TO THE Englishman . “ Did might be . He needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war . understands that soul can also understand the language of things . I they could be written on the surface of an emerald . ” magic the strange and the laboratory equipment … none of this had made an impression on the boy . His He took back his books and packed them away again in their bags . and the sand raised by the animals . “ Everyone has his or her own THE CARAVAN BEGAN TO TRAVEL DAY AND NIGHT . THE hooded Bedouins had become a good friend of the boy ’ s — explained that the war between the tribes had already begun . The caravan would be very lucky to reach the oasis . themselves less and less . The silence was the worst aspect of the because it might signal a raid . the threat of war . “ Because I don ’ t live in either my past or my future . I ’ m interested only in the present . If you can concentrate always on the looked for the star they followed every night . He thought that the stars on the desert itself . “ Because we have to sleep . ” early . But the boy was quiet . He was at home with the silence of the would just be a memory . But this was the present moment — the party the camel driver had mentioned — and he wanted to live it as he did the lessons of his past and his dreams of the future . Although could herald a miracle . as he watched the hundreds of people and animals arriving at the excitement at the arrival of the strangers . The alchemist saw the at length . But none of that mattered to the alchemist . He had already seen had seen kings and beggars walking the desert sands . The dunes sands he had known since he was a child . He always enjoyed seeing Maybe God created the desert so that man could appreciate the date He decided to concentrate on more practical matters . He knew that in the caravan there was a man to whom he was to teach some of his secrets . The omens had told him so . He didn ’ t know the man He hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice . I don ’ t know why these things have to be transmitted by word of revealed his secrets easily to all his creatures . He had only one explanation for this fact : things have to be and this kind of life cannot be captured in pictures or words . wind up forgetting the Language of the World . being just a well surrounded by a few palm trees — as he had seen once in a geography book — was much larger than many towns back and innumerable colored tents spread among them . impatient to meet with the alchemist . animals and people that were arriving . The men of the oasis wanted with one another for access to the cloth and precious stones brought by the merchants . The silence of the desert was a distant world and found themselves once again in the world of people . They were relieved and happy . camel driver explained to the boy that oases were always inhabitants were women and children . There were oases leaving the oases as places of refuge . people together and gave them his instructions . The group was to remain there at the oasis until the conflict between the tribes was accommodations . That was the law of hospitality . Then he asked the men appointed by the tribal chieftains . may not shelter armies or troops . ” revolver out of his bag and gave it to the men who were collecting the arms . “ Why a revolver ? ” he asked . seemed as if what the old king had called “ beginner ’ s luck ” were no constantly subjected to tests of his persistence and courage . So he he would fail to see the signs and omens left by God along his path . God placed them along my path . He had surprised himself with job . He had never thought of them in terms of a language used by God to indicate what he should do . driver said : ‘ Eat when it ’ s time to eat . And move along when it ’ s time to move along . ’ ” tent with five other young men of about his age . They were people tell them of his experiences at the crystal shop when the Englishman came into the tent . outside . “ I need you to help me find out where the alchemist lives . ” probably live in a manner that was different from that of the rest of the oasis was much larger than they could have imagined ; there were hundreds of tents . sitting down with the boy near one of the wells . The Englishman didn ’ t want to tell others about his reasons for The boy approached a woman who had come to the well to fill a goatskin with water . alchemist lives here at the oasis . ” because they were married women . He should respect tradition . The Englishman was disappointed . It seemed he had made the long journey for nothing . The boy was also saddened ; his friend was that ’ s what the old king had said . He couldn ’ t have been wrong . The Englishman ’ s eyes lit up . “ That ’ s it ! Maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is ! Find out who it is who cures the people ’ s illnesses ! ” insistence . Then a man approached . “ Do you know someone here who cures people ’ s illnesses ? ” the boy asked . strangers . “ You ’ re looking for witch doctors . ” He spoke some verses bucket . The boy repeated his question . “ Why do you want to find that sort of person ? ” the Arab asked . “ Because my friend here has traveled for many months in order the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to . Only when he consents . “ Wait for the end of the war . Then leave with the caravan . Don ’ t But the Englishman was exultant . They were on the right track . ask about the alchemist . Soul of the World surged within him . When he looked into her dark he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke — the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart . It was love . Something older than crystals and in the silence of the desert . It was the pure Language of the World . It required no endless time . What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in than of anything in the world . He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed . But maybe people who felt that way under the sun has been written by one hand only . It is the hand that the same . “ What ’ s your name ? ” he asked . “ That ’ s what some women in my country are called . ” invaders carried the name everywhere . ” The beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride . man who cured people ’ s illnesses . said . “ He communicates with the genies of the desert . ” The genies were the spirits of good and evil . And the girl pointed she filled her vessel with water and left . day in Tarifa the levanter had brought to him the perfume of that she existed . He knew that his love for her would enable him to discover every treasure in the world . asked me if I had ever transformed lead into gold . I told him that was what I had come here to learn . “ He told me I should try to do so . That ’ s all he said : ‘ Go and try . ’ ” The boy didn ’ t say anything . The poor Englishman had traveled already done so many times . “ That ’ s what I ’ m going to do . I ’ m going to start now . ” water . my wife . I love you . ” “ I ’ m going to wait here for you every day . I have crossed the it brought me to you . ” The boy looked around him at the date palms . He reminded shepherd again . Fatima was more important than his treasure . if she had guessed what he was thinking . “ And the women of the desert are proud of their tribesmen . ” She refilled her vessel and left . The boy went to the well every day to meet with Fatima . He told of the caravan called a meeting of all of the people traveling with him . important to both armies . It ’ s not a battle of good against evil . It ’ s a Allah is on both sides . ” went to meet with Fatima that afternoon . He told her about the become a part of you . ” more beautiful than the sound of the wind in the date palms . “ I have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time . I which men of the desert expect women to behave . Ever since I was a The boy wanted to take her hand . But Fatima ’ s hands held to the handles of her jug . it . “ That ’ s why I want you to continue toward your goal . If you have our love for each other . come back one day . ” The boy was sad as he left her that day . He thought of all the married shepherds he had known . They had a difficult time convincing their wives that they had to go off into distant fields . Love required them to stay with the people they loved . hide in the ravines and of the water that comes from the earth . They become a part of everything … they become the Soul of the World . “ Some do come back . And then the other women are happy too will be one of the women who wait . The boy went to look for the Englishman . He wanted to tell him about Fatima . He was surprised when he saw that the Englishman they had when he was reading his books . was my fear of failure that first kept me from attempting the Master But I ’ m happy at least that I didn ’ t wait twenty years . ” desert turned pink in the setting sun . He felt the urge to go out into to become hypnotized by the horizon . He tried to deal with the He watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind . Although sense to the boy . It was just that he couldn ’ t grasp what it meant . He it . Maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership . everything in the world is beginning to make sense to me … even the materialized over the sands of the desert . But he certainly didn ’ t desire that an army invade the oasis . meditation . He tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the that wouldn ’ t allow him to do so . to occur . dangerous . observing the sunset . He saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes . answered . But the boy told him about the hawks : that he had been watching their flight and had suddenly felt himself to have plunged to the Soul of the World . The camel driver understood what the boy was saying . He knew that any given thing on the face of the earth could reveal the history means of penetration to the Soul of the World . The desert was full of men who earned their living based on the ease with which they could penetrate to the Soul of the World . They would be impossible to be effective in battle if one knew that he was thrill of not knowing what the outcome would be ; the future was of many things : Where was the enemy ’ s sword ? Where was his horse ? What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to consulted with seers . Many of them had been right about what they had ever sought out ( and the one most to be feared ) had asked why the camel driver was so interested in the future . change those things that I don ’ t want to happen . ” said . myself for what ’ s coming . ” greatly before they even occur . ” driver had said to the seer . “ And men always live their lives based on the future . ” The seer was a specialist in the casting of twigs ; he threw them cloth and put them back in his bag . omens that are here in the present . guess at the future ? Based on the omens of the present . The secret is The camel driver had asked what the circumstances were under which God would allow him to see the future . that was written so as to be altered . ” thought . Why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument ? “ Tell them about the armies that are approaching . ” “ They ’ ll laugh at me . ” to dealing with omens . ” “ They ’ re not concerned with that right now . They believe that if someone will tell them about it . It has happened many times before . The boy thought of Fatima . And he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes . THE BOY APPROACHED THE GUARD AT THE FRONT OF THE huge white tent at the center of the oasis . “ I want to see the chieftains . I ’ ve brought omens from the desert . ” into the tent . conversation with her . boy was astonished by what he saw inside . Never could he have like this one . The ground was covered with the most beautiful resting upon richly embroidered silk cushions . Servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea . Other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs . The atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke . which of them was the most important : an Arab dressed in white young Arab the boy had spoken with earlier . “ Who is this stranger who speaks of omens ? ” asked one of the knows that we have been here for generations ? ” said another of the chieftains . said . “ I can see things that eyes habituated to the desert might not see . ” to himself . third chieftain . you don ’ t have to do anything about it . ” The men fell into an animated discussion . They spoke in an told him that something was wrong . He regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert . and the boy felt better . The man hadn ’ t participated in the feel the vibrations of peace throughout the tent . Now his intuition was that he had been right in coming . The discussion ended . The chieftains were silent for a few moments as they listened to what the old man was saying . Then he turned to the boy : this time his expression was cold and distant . know that whoever believes in dreams also knows how to interpret them . ” “ We always observe the Tradition . The Tradition saved Egypt how their children should marry . The Tradition says that an oasis is vulnerable . ” No one said a word as the old man continued . “ But the Tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert . Everything we know was taught to us by the desert . ” again : no one at the oasis may carry arms . Throughout the entire day we will once again surrender their arms to me . For every ten dead men “ But arms cannot be drawn unless they also go into battle . Arms time they might not function . If at least one of them hasn ’ t been began to make his way there . He was alarmed by what had happened . He had succeeded in having done so might be his life . It was a frightening bet . But he had been making risky bets ever since the day he had sold his sheep to die tomorrow was no worse than dying on any other day . Every day was there to be lived or to mark one ’ s departure from this world . Everything depended on one word : “ Maktub . ” silence of the desert and Fatima ’ s eyes . He had lived every one of his days intensely since he had left home so long ago . If he died and he was proud of that . the ground by a wind such as he had never known . The area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view . Before frightening scream . what he saw . Astride the animal was a horseman dressed with a black kerchief . He appeared to be a messenger from the mere messenger . scabbard mounted on his saddle . The steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon . “ Who dares to read the meaning of the flight of the hawks ? ” he fifty thousand palm trees of Al-Fayoum . except that now the roles were reversed . I was able to see through to the Soul of the World . ” until the point touched the boy ’ s forehead . It drew a droplet of blood . sense of joy : he was about to die in pursuit of his Personal Legend . that Soul . The stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy ’ s forehead . “ Why did you read the flight of the birds ? ” “ I read only what the birds wanted to tell me . They wanted to men at the oasis than you have . ” The sword remained where it was . “ Who are you to change what Allah has willed ? ” taught me the language of the birds . Everything has been written by words . the boy felt immensely relieved . But he still couldn ’ t flee . of the battle . ” The stranger seemed satisfied with the answer . But he kept the sword in his hand . “ What is a stranger doing in a strange land ? ” “ I am following my Personal Legend . It ’ s not something you would understand . ” relaxed . quality most essential to understanding the Language of the World . ” The boy was surprised . The stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about . those who become distracted . ” What he said reminded the boy of the old king . The same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip . away . The hand with the whip pointed to the south . The boy had met the alchemist . throughout the palm trees at Al-Fayoum . Before the sun had horizon . The mounted troops entered the oasis from the north ; it hidden in their robes . When they reached the white tent at the they attacked an empty tent . The men of the oasis surrounded the horsemen from the desert and within half an hour all but one of the intruders were dead . The and saw nothing of what had happened . The women had remained The only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion . asked him why he had violated the Tradition . The commander said return to the war . that the Tradition was sacred . He condemned the commander to desert wind . asked the boy to become the counselor of the oasis . and a group of Arabs passing by told the boy that it was a place inhabited by genies . But the boy sat down and waited . Not until the moon was high did the alchemist ride into view . He carried two dead hawks over his shoulder . Personal Legend that brings you here ? ” desert . So I have come here . ” boy should enter the tent with him . It was a tent like many at the oasis . The boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus mysterious designs . said the alchemist . The boy suspected that they were the same hawks he had seen scent of the hookahs . “ Why did you want to see me ? ” the boy asked . Englishman . He ’ s the one that ’ s looking for you . ” “ He has other things to do first . But he ’ s on the right track . He has begun to try to understand the desert . ” “ And what about me ? ” Another person was there to help him toward his Personal Legend . “ So you are going to instruct me ? ” “ No . You already know all you need to know . I am only going to point you in the direction of your treasure . ” “ I know what ’ s happening in the desert . ” “ I also have Fatima . She is a treasure greater than anything else I have won . ” They ate in silence . The alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy ’ s cup . It was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted . “ Isn ’ t wine prohibited here ? ” the boy asked alchemist . “ It ’ s what comes out of their mouths that is . ” under a moon so brilliant that it made the stars pale . everything you have learned along the way can make sense . traitorous : they walk thousands of paces and never seem to tire . they are about to die . ” where there is life out in the desert . Only those who can see such signs of life are able to find treasure . ” thought . I don ’ t know the desert that well yet . man . They reached the rocky place where the boy had seen the And then the boy understood . He loosened the reins on his followed as the boy ’ s horse ran for almost half an hour . They could no longer see the palms of the oasis — only the gigantic moon above alchemist ’ s eyes — the boy could see only his eyes — squinted with his effort . His arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the minutes . with the snakes of the desert . The boy watched as his companion went to his horse and then he placed the snake within it . The serpent relaxed immediately . “ Why was that so important ? ” “ Because the Pyramids are surrounded by the desert . ” The boy didn ’ t want to talk about the Pyramids . His heart was continue his search for the treasure meant that he had to abandon Fatima . treasure . ” knows that men have to go away in order to return . And she already has her treasure : it ’ s you . Now she expects that you will find what it is you ’ re looking for . ” “ Let me tell you what will happen . You ’ ll be the counselor of the oasis . You have enough gold to buy many sheep and many camels . how the world is always changing . And you ’ ll get better and better there is . try to ignore them . You ’ ll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants . The tribal chieftains will appreciate what you do . And your camels will bring you wealth and power . she ’ ll return your love . You ’ ll remember that she never asked you to man . So you won ’ t blame her . But many times you ’ ll walk the sands could have trusted more in your love for Fatima . Because what kept you at the oasis was your own fear that you might never come back . forever . and a great deal of merchandise . You ’ ll spend the rest of your days it ’ s too late . “ You must understand that love never keeps a man from because it wasn ’ t true love … the love that speaks the Language of the World . ” slithered away among the rocks . The boy remembered the crystal Englishman in search of the alchemist . He thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert . And he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved . followed the alchemist back to the oasis . The wind brought the strange horseman with the falcon on his shoulder had spoken of Legend . in his heart . response . friend enough gold to buy a sheep . Then he asked his friend to go into the tent where Fatima was buy yet another sheep . sheep . Fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent . The two walked out among the palms . The boy knew that it was a violation of the coming back . I love you because … ” one is loved . No reason is needed for loving . ” the entire universe conspired to help me find you . ” The two embraced . It was the first time either had touched the other . then . ” They said nothing else . They walked a bit farther among the said . He saw that Fatima ’ s eyes were filled with tears . “ You ’ re crying ? ” out to do the chores she had done for years . But everything had never again have the same meaning it had had only yesterday . It would no longer be a place with fifty thousand palm trees and three place for her . boy was following in search of his treasure . She would have to send the hope for his return . the boy as they began to ride across the sands of the desert . forever . ” boy said . He was already reaccustomed to the desert ’ s silence . one can always come back . If what you had found was only a on your return . ” The man was speaking the language of alchemy . But the boy knew that he was referring to Fatima . It was difficult not to think about what he had left behind . The camel driver who was a teacher without realizing it . Maybe the speaking only of the precautions they needed to follow in order to failed to observe . offered his water container to the boy . “ I congratulate you for having pursued your Personal Legend . ” thought you were going to teach me some of the things you know . A alchemy . But I wasn ’ t able to learn anything from them . ” through action . Everything you need to know you have learned through your journey . You need to learn only one thing more . ” “ Why are you called the alchemist ? ” “ Because that ’ s what I am . ” “ And what went wrong when other alchemists tried to make gold and were unable to do so ? ” wanting actually to live out the Personal Legend . ” “ What is it that I still need to know ? ” the boy asked . But the alchemist continued to look to the horizon . And finally the falcon returned with their meal . They dug a hole and lit their fire feel that they knew a better way than others had . Yet the Emerald Tablet is still alive today . ” “ What was written on the Emerald Tablet ? ” the boy wanted to know . as if it had taken place years and years ago . The boy tried to read what was written in the sand . saw in the Englishman ’ s books . ” hawks ; it can ’ t be understood by reason alone . The Emerald Tablet is a direct passage to the Soul of the World . “ The wise men understood that this natural world is only an image and a copy of paradise . The existence of this world is simply a guarantee that there exists a world that is perfect . God created the spiritual teachings and the marvels of his wisdom . That ’ s what I mean by action . ” “ Should I understand the Emerald Tablet ? ” the boy asked . the right time to study the best way to understand the Emerald Tablet . But you are in the desert . So immerse yourself in it . The on the face of the earth will do that . You don ’ t even have to understand the desert : all you have to do is contemplate a simple “ How do I immerse myself in the desert ? ” THEY CROSSED THE DESERT FOR ANOTHER TWO DAYS IN silence . The approaching the area where the most violent battles were being times it became so emotional over the desert sunrise that the boy had to hide his tears . His heart beat fastest when it spoke to the boy when the boy and the alchemist had fallen into silence . they had made camp that day . treasure . ” when I ’ m thinking about her . ” has to say . ” boy ’ s heart began to speak of fear . It told him stories it had heard treasure and never succeeded . Sometimes it frightened the boy with satisfied : it had found love and riches . had paused to rest the horses . “ It doesn ’ t want me to go on . ” you ’ ve won . ” “ Because you will never again be able to keep it quiet . Even if and about the world . ” “ Treason is a blow that comes unexpectedly . If you know your “ You will never be able to escape from your heart . So it ’ s better unanticipated blow . ” The boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the suffer terribly . ” alchemist one night as they looked up at the moonless sky . “ Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself . And that no heart has ever suffered when it goes in second ’ s encounter with God and with eternity . ” was a part of the dream that I would find it . When I have been truly I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve . ” things that came from the Soul of the World . It said that all people who are happy have God within them . And that happiness could be has taken millions of years to create it . “ Everyone on earth has a want to go in search of them . We speak of them only to children . we don ’ t want people to suffer because they don ’ t follow their hearts . ” “ Why don ’ t people ’ s hearts tell them to continue to follow their dreams ? ” the boy asked the alchemist . like to suffer . ” message . understood that the boy ’ s heart had returned to the Soul of the World . “ So what should I do now ? ” the boy asked . “ And continue to pay heed to the omens . Your heart is still capable of showing you where the treasure is . ” “ Is that the one thing I still needed to know ? ” everything that was learned along the way . It does this not because master the lessons we ’ ve learned as we ’ ve moved toward that dream . That ’ s the point at which most people give up . It ’ s the point just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon . ’ “ Every search begins with beginner ’ s luck . And every search ends with the victor ’ s being severely tested . ” The boy remembered an old proverb from his country . It said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn . the alchemist were doing there . “ We ’ re going to have to search you to see whether you ’ re had searched the boy ’ s bag . The tribesman who was searching the alchemist ’ s belongings that was slightly larger than a chicken ’ s egg . “ What are these things ? ” he asked . “ That ’ s the Philosopher ’ s Stone and the Elixir of Life . It ’ s the Master Work of the alchemists . Whoever swallows that elixir will into gold . ” alchemist to proceed with all of their belongings . moved on . “ What did you do that for ? ” the boy ’ s heart became more and more silent . It no longer wanted to know about things of the past or future ; it was content simply to was capable now of betraying the other . the desert were wearisome . His heart told the boy what his strongest qualities were : his courage in having given up his sheep during the time he had worked at the crystal shop . And his heart told him something else that the boy had never he had never perceived . His heart said that one time it had hidden that the boy might wound himself . And it reminded the boy of the he had fallen into a deep sleep . There had been two thieves farther ahead who were planning to steal the boy ’ s sheep and murder him . thinking that he had changed his route . “ Does a man ’ s heart always help him ? ” the boy asked the alchemist . “ Mostly just the hearts of those who are trying to realize their “ Does that mean that I ’ ll never run into danger ? ” said . tribes . At each corner of the camp were Arabs garbed in beautiful hookahs and trading stories from the battlefield . No one paid any attention to the two travelers . the encampment . forget that you ’ re in the desert . When men are at war with one one fails to suffer the consequences of everything under the sun . ” appeared from behind the travelers . where the tribes are at war . ” straight into the eyes of the horsemen . They were silent for a move along . The boy watched the exchange with fascination . “ You dominated alchemist . been one who stared fixedly at the two . He had been so far away that his face wasn ’ t even visible . But the boy was certain that he had been looking at them . only two days from the Pyramids . teach me about alchemy . ” “ You already know about alchemy . It is about penetrating to the reserved for you . ” into gold . ” only after they had stopped to eat . don ’ t know why . I just know that the Tradition is always right . conflict . ” But then he stopped . The alchemist probably already knew all that . thing evolves as well . “ Others stumbled upon the stone by accident . They already had of others . But they don ’ t count . They ’ re quite rare . iron have their own Personal Legends to fulfill . And anyone who interferes with the Personal Legend of another thing never will discover his own . ” The alchemist ’ s words echoed out like a curse . He reached over and picked up a shell from the ground . The alchemist told the boy to place the shell over his ear . He had of the sea . Legend . And it will never cease doing so until the desert is once again covered by water . ” Pyramids of Egypt . THE SUN WAS SETTING WHEN THE BOY ’ S HEART SOUNDED a danger signal . alchemist to see whether he had sensed anything . But he appeared horsemen waiting ahead of them . Before he could say anything to hundred . And then they were everywhere in the dunes . surrounding their turbans . Their faces were hidden behind blue souls . And their eyes spoke of death . THE TWO WERE TAKEN TO A NEARBY MILITARY CAMP . A soldier shoved the boy and the alchemist into a tent where the chief was holding a meeting with his staff . “ You were seen at the enemy camp three days ago . And you were talking with one of the troops there . ” said the alchemist . “ I have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes . I was simply acting as a guide for my friend here . ” “ Who is your friend ? ” the chief asked . nature . And he wants to show you his extraordinary powers . ” The boy listened quietly . And fearfully . “ What is a foreigner doing here ? ” asked another of the men . alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief . The Arab accepted them without a word . There was enough there to buy a lot of weapons . “ It ’ s a man who understands nature and the world . If he wanted knew that the wind could not deliver them a fatal blow . Yet each felt were fearful of sorcerers . tribe . ” of the tent . But the boy couldn ’ t even speak . He was able to do so only after they had walked through the center of the camp . There was no need an impenetrable wall . “ You gave them everything I had ! ” the boy said . “ Everything I ’ ve saved in my entire life ! ” alchemist answered . “ Your money saved us for three days . It ’ s not often that money saves a person ’ s life . ” But the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom . He had no idea how he was going to transform himself into the wind . He wasn ’ t an alchemist ! alchemist muttered some words that the boy didn ’ t understand . “ But I have no idea how to turn myself into the wind . ” everything he needs to know . There is only one thing that makes a dream impossible to achieve : the fear of failure . ” “ I ’ m not afraid of failing . It ’ s just that I don ’ t know how to turn myself into the wind . ” “ But what if I can ’ t ? ” “ Then you ’ ll die in the midst of trying to realize your Personal who never even knew what their Personal Legends were . of death makes people a lot more aware of their lives . ” number of wounded were brought back to the camp . The dead of his companions . “ You could have died after peace had been who had taken his falcon out into the desert . repeated . “ Remember what I told you : the world is only the visible aspect of God . And that what alchemy does is to bring spiritual perfection into contact with the material plane . ” “ What are you doing ? ” “ Feeding my falcon . ” the boy said . “ Why feed your falcon ? ” know how to turn myself into the wind . ” camp . The sentinels allowed him to go ; they had already heard He spent the entire afternoon of the second day looking out over sensed his fear . They both spoke the same language . himself into the wind . ” The boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day . He told them all to be seated . desert . ” The boy looked out at the horizon . There were mountains in the living where survival seemed impossible . There was the desert that palm trees and three hundred wells . “ What do you want here today ? ” the desert asked him . “ Didn ’ t you spend enough time looking at me yesterday ? ” the wind . ” “ What is love ? ” the desert asked . generous to him . ” answered . “ To nourish the falcon . And the falcon then nourishes will once again flourish . That ’ s how the world goes . ” “ So is that what love is ? ” “ But you can at least understand that somewhere in your sands there is a woman waiting for me . And that ’ s why I have to turn myself into the wind . ” The desert didn ’ t answer him for a few moments . wind . ” A breeze began to blow . The tribesmen watched the boy from a couldn ’ t understand . The alchemist smiled . The wind approached the boy and touched his face . It knew of to die . loved one to me . ” “ Who taught you to speak the language of the desert and the wind ? ” things . ” I love . ” “ I heard what you were talking about the other day with the Personal Legend . But people can ’ t turn themselves into the wind . ” “ So you and I can talk about the limitless possibilities of people and the winds . ” know how to turn a man into the wind . And look how many things that there were other things the wind should be able to do . wind . And it knew nothing about love . having to acknowledge its own limitations . “ Maybe it ’ s better to ask heaven . ” sandstorm so strong that it blots out the sun . Then I can look to heaven without blinding myself . ” sand . The sun was turned into a golden disk . desert were already familiar with that wind . They called it the and all their weapons were filled with sand . They could barely see the boy . Their faces were covered with the “ I want to see how a man turns himself into the wind . ” But he made a mental note of the names of the two men who had are not afraid . grow and the sheep to seek out shade . From where I am — and I ’ m a long way from the earth — I learned how to love . I know that if I and the Soul of the World would no longer exist . So we contemplate and it gives me my reason for living . ” great length to each other during this endless trip through the only the minerals and vegetables understand that all things are one . the same as gold . Each performs its own exact function as a unique that wrote all this had stopped on the fifth day of creation . the boy said . “ But you don ’ t know about love . If there hadn ’ t been a but one day that Personal Legend will be realized . So each thing has thing only . ” was in his former life . Lead will play its role until the world has no further need for lead ; and then lead will have to turn itself into gold . too . ” asked the boy . roam the world like the wind . And it ’ s not love to see everything become better or worse . And that ’ s where the power of love comes we are . ” “ So what do you want of me ? ” the sun asked . answered . “ But I don ’ t know how to turn you into the wind . ” and wanted to tell every corner of the world that the sun ’ s wisdom had its limitations . That it was unable to deal with this boy who spoke the Language of the World . each other as they sought to keep from being blown away . speak . prayer without words or pleas . His prayer didn ’ t give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures ; it didn ’ t ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal ; and it didn ’ t beseech that the woman he had single emerald . He saw that omens were scattered throughout the man into the wind . Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work . it was a part of the Soul of God . And he saw that the Soul of God was THE SIMUM BLEW THAT DAY AS IT HAD NEVER BLOWN before . For where the boy had been . But he was no longer there ; he was camp . The men were terrified at his sorcery . But there were two the glory of God . them as far as they chose . the escorts they could return to the camp . only three hours from the Pyramids . ” World . ” “ I only invoked what you already knew . ” The alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery . A monk dressed in black came to the gates . They spoke for a few minutes in smiled . They went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery . The which the alchemist placed in an iron pan . When the lead had and added it to the pan in which the lead had melted . The monk was irritated . The caravans had been stopped at Giza the monk said . longer lead . It was gold . “ Will I learn to do that someday ? ” the boy asked . answered . “ But I wanted to show you that it was possible . ” alchemist separated the disk into four parts . monk . “ It ’ s for your generosity to the pilgrims . ” responded . the next time . ” The alchemist turned to the boy . “ This is for you . To make up for what you gave to the general . ” The boy was about to say that it was much more than he had alchemist said to the monk . He took the fourth part and handed it to the monk . “ This is for the boy . If he ever needs it . ” close to it now . ” “ Then why this ? ” “ Because you have already lost your savings twice . Once to the happens once can never happen again . But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time . ’ ” They mounted their horses . The boy brought his horse closer . sent to the most distant regions of the empire . The other son was a and told him that the words of one of his sons would be learned and repeated throughout the world for all generations to come . The proud to know . who was about to be crushed by the wheels of a chariot . Since he in his dream . any wish you desire . ’ son ’ s poems will be read by men for generations to come . I don ’ t want anything for myself . But any father would be proud of the to see my son ’ s words . ’ surrounded by thousands of people speaking a strange language . “ The man wept with happiness . angel through his tears . ‘ Can you please tell me which of my son ’ s poems these people are repeating ? ’ “ ‘ The verses of your son who was the poet were very popular in words you ’ re hearing now are those of your son in the military . ’ “ The man looked at the angel in surprise . he was seeking was the Son of God . He met others who had been where the man he was looking for was visiting . ’ rabbi made ready to go to his house with him . But the centurion was he was surely in the presence of the Son of God . ’ under my roof . But only speak a word and my servant will be healed . ” ” ’ earth plays a central role in the history of the world . And normally he doesn ’ t know it . ” The boy smiled . He had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd . avidly to what his heart had to say . It was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden . alchemist had told him . story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful change . “ Be aware of the place where you are brought to tears . That ’ s where The boy climbed the dune slowly . A full moon rose again in the starry sky : it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis . appearance of a rolling sea ; it reminded the boy of the day when journey in search of treasure . illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the The boy fell to his knees and wept . He thanked God for making for his having met a woman of the desert who had told him that love would never keep a man from his Personal Legend . He didn ’ t need to demonstrate his science and art to anyone . The everything he might have dreamed of . reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said : that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard . The boy could see now that he couldn ’ t do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life . but found nothing . He felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the Pyramids had been built . But he didn ’ t stop . He struggled sand back into the excavation . His hands were abraded and his tears fell . heard footsteps . Several figures approached him . Their backs were faces . “ What are you doing here ? ” one of the figures demanded . other figure said . “ What are you hiding there ? ” But one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the gold . in the man ’ s eyes the boy saw death . “ He ’ s probably got more gold hidden in the ground . ” near . “ What good is money to you if you ’ re going to die ? It ’ s not often that he had twice dreamed of a treasure hidden near the Pyramids of Egypt . The man who appeared to be the leader of the group spoke to one of the others : “ Leave him . He doesn ’ t have anything else . He must have stolen this gold . ” look for a ruined church where shepherds and their sheep slept . In would find a hidden treasure . But I ’ m not so stupid as to cross an entire desert just because of a recurrent dream . ” And they disappeared . heart bursting with joy . Because now he knew where his treasure was . EPILOGUE could still be seen through the half-destroyed roof . He remembered the time he had been there with his sheep ; it had been a peaceful night … except for the dream . He sat looking at the sky for a long time . Then he took from his looked at the stars and drank wine together . He thought of the many show him his treasure . If he hadn ’ t believed in the significance of himself . began to dig at the base of the sycamore . whole story . You even left a bit of gold at the monastery so I could get back to this church . The monk laughed when he saw me come back in tatters . Couldn ’ t you have saved me from that ? ” with jewels . The spoils of a conquest that the country had long ago about . The boy took out Urim and Thummim from his bag . He had used marketplace . His life and his path had always provided him with enough omens . He placed Urim and Thummim in the chest . They were also a It ’ s true ; life really is generous to those who pursue their to get to Tarifa so he could give one-tenth of his treasure to the he thought . Maybe it was because they moved around so much . The boy smiled . It was the first time she had done that . ABOUT THE AUTHOR he now lives .
